// NereusSDR-original file. No Thetis logic ported here — Thetis bakes
// mic-source selection directly into audio.cs rather than using the
// strategy pattern. CompositeTxMicRouter is a NereusSDR-native selector
// that holds PcMicSource + RadioMicSource and dispatches pullSamples
// to the active source at runtime.

/// Radio — Radio mic-jack input via P1/P2 mic-frame stream.
///          Requires hasMicJack == true (not available on HL2).
/// Vax   — Audio routed to "NereusSDR TX" virtual device by a 3rd-
///          party app (FreeDV, WSJT-X, etc.).  Pulled from
///          /nereussdr-vax-tx shared memory by the HAL plugin →
///          CoreAudioHalBus → VaxTxMicSource.  Requires the VAX TX
///          mic source to have been registered via setVaxSource()
///          (called by RadioModel after engine start). If the VAX
///          source is null when MicSource::Vax is selected, the
///          router falls through to Pc as a safety default rather
///          than emitting silence.

/// setActiveSource(Radio) is silently ignored. The effective source
/// is always Pc on HL2 regardless of user selection.
///
/// MOX-locked: source switching while MOX is active is deferred.
/// setActiveSource() during TX records the request as "pending" and
/// applies it on the next setMoxActive(false) transition. This prevents
/// audible clicks and mid-TX mic-buffer state inconsistency.
///
/// Constructor takes non-owning pointers. The router does not own its
/// sources — lifetime is managed by the caller (RadioModel in production).
///
/// hasMicJack is collapsed with radioSource at construction: if either
/// hasMicJack is false OR radioSource is nullptr, the router behaves as
/// if Radio is unavailable (force-PC). This means passing a non-null

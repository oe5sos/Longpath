// RadioConnection::micFrameDecoded (added in 3M-1b Task F.4).

/// RadioMicSource — TxMicRouter implementation that drains a lock-free
/// SPSC float ring fed by RadioConnection::micFrameDecoded.
///
/// Threading model (SPSC):
///   Producer: RadioConnection (network I/O thread) emits micFrameDecoded
///             via DirectConnection → onMicFrame slot pushes to ring.
///   Consumer: WDSP audio thread calls pullSamples() to drain the ring.
///
/// Ring design: 4096 float samples (~85 ms at 48 kHz). Power-of-two
/// capacity allows bitwise masking instead of modulo for index wrap.
/// Monotonic unsigned counters avoid UB on overflow (unsigned overflow
/// is defined by the C++ standard; the effective index is obtained via
/// `idx & kMask`). At 48 kHz mono, a counter increments at 48000/s.
/// A 32-bit unsigned counter wraps after 2^32 / 48000 ≈ 24.8 hours —
/// harmless because the index extraction `& kMask` sees only the low
/// bits. Reads and writes remain coherent across the wrap.
///
/// Overflow handling: when the ring is full, onMicFrame drops the
/// excess samples and increments m_dropped for diagnostics. This is
/// more appropriate than the yielding pushCopy pattern (AudioRingSpsc)
/// because onMicFrame runs on the connection thread which must not
/// block the network I/O loop.
///
/// Underrun handling: pullSamples zero-fills the remainder when fewer
/// samples are available than requested. Zero-fill produces silence,
/// which is more user-friendly than repeating stale audio or glitching.
/// pullSamples always returns `n` (the requested count) regardless of
/// underrun — the audio pipeline always gets a full buffer.
///
/// Constructor takes a non-owning RadioConnection*. Passing nullptr is
/// safe (no slot is connected; pullSamples always returns zero-fill).
///

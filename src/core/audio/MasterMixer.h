// Phase 3O per-slice mute / volume / pan mixer. Per-slice gain, pan,
// mute and the anti-click ramp are NereusSDR-original; the ring +
// barrier structure is derived from Thetis, see below.
//
// Phase 3F: reworked from a single shared accumulator into per-slice
// rings behind a readiness barrier, so that N slices produce ONE mixed
// block per audio period instead of N separate pushes.
//
// The structure (per-producer ring + readiness barrier + one summed
// output) follows Thetis's ChannelMaster mixer, read for reference at
// v2.10.3.15:
//
//   aamix.c:237  xMixAudio()  -- per-stream ring, memcpy in, release a
//                                readiness semaphore once a full output
//                                block is queued
//   aamix.c:43   mix_main()   -- WaitForMultipleObjects(nactive, Aready,
//                                TRUE, INFINITE) then sum, then ONE
//                                outbound push
//   aamix.c:486               -- explicit semaphore release when a stream
//                                is deactivated, so a stopped stream can
//                                not wedge the barrier
//
// Three deliberate divergences from that reference, all recorded here
// because they are design decisions rather than translation slips:
//
//  1. No dedicated mixer thread. Thetis needs one because its producers
//     run on different threads. Every NereusSDR producer is already
//     serialised on the single RxDspWorker DSP thread, so the drain runs
//     inline and skips a thread handoff.
//
//  2. No per-stream resamplers. Thetis resamples inside the mixer
//     because its streams can arrive at different rates. NereusSDR sizes
//     each stream's DSP block with bufferSizeForRate(), which scales the
//     input size linearly with the sample rate, so every stream emits one
//     64-frame 48 kHz block per period whatever its DDC rate. Cadences
//     match by construction and the rings only ever absorb jitter.
//
//  3. Barrier membership is asymmetric: a slice JOINS implicitly on its
//     first block, but LEAVES only when the slice lifecycle withdraws it
//     through setSliceStreaming(false). That mirrors SetAAudioMixState
//     (aamix.c:522), which is the only way a stream leaves the mix
//     upstream. There is no timeout anywhere, matching mix_main's
//     unbounded WaitForMultipleObjects (aamix.c:43).
//
//     Joining implicitly is safe because it can only ever SHRINK the set
//     the drain waits on, so it cannot cause a slice to be dropped from
//     a mixed block. Leaving implicitly is not safe, and an earlier
//     revision of this file proved it: it demoted a member after two
//     consecutive empty drains. Two DDCs deliver in clumps rather than
//     alternating, so a burst from one slice repeatedly tripped that
//     threshold, and the mixer emitted blocks carrying a single receiver
//     and pushed more blocks than periods had elapsed. That is the
//     2026-07-27 ANAN-G2E bench defect (audio scratchy and robotic with
//     two pans up, clean again as soon as one was closed).
//
//     The cost of this choice is that a missed setSliceStreaming(false)
//     silences the mix until the slice is withdrawn or removed. That is
//     deliberate: a wedge is loud and immediately diagnosable, whereas
//     the timeout it replaces failed quietly, degrading audio in a way
//     that took a bench session to localise.
//
//  4. Up-slew is ported; DOWN-slew is not. Thetis brackets a membership
//     change with both: close_mixer raises slew.dflag and blocks until the
//     fade-out completes before shutting the gates (aamix.c:471-478), then
//     open_mixer fades back in. It can fade out because its mixer thread
//     keeps turning independently of its producers, so it still has output
//     blocks to shape after a stream stops feeding.
//
//     Ours cannot. The drain runs inline on the producer thread
//     (divergence 1), so when the gated slice stops delivering there is no
//     further output to apply a fade-out to: the audio simply stops
//     arriving. Porting the down-slew would mean porting the mixer thread
//     with it. The audible half that is reachable, and the half the bench
//     actually reported, is the resume.
//
// Click-free join and leave is a per-slice gain ramp rather than a port
// of Thetis's upslew/downslew state machine (aamix.c:280-...), which
// gates the MIXED output on whether data is non-zero and is built for
// VAC stream start/stop, not for one slice among several coming and
// going. Ramping the per-slice gain targets our actual artifact and
// keeps the audio-thread path branch-light.
//
// Ported from Thetis sources (structural derivation, not a line-by-line
// translation -- the architecture is upstream's, the semantics are ours):
//   Project Files/Source/ChannelMaster/aamix.c [v2.10.3.15]
//     (per-producer ring + readiness barrier + one summed output)
//
// =================================================================
// Modification history (NereusSDR):
//   2026-07-27 -- Per-slice mute / volume / pan mixer reworked from a
//                 single shared accumulator into per-slice rings behind
//                 a readiness barrier, so N slices produce ONE mixed
//                 block per audio period instead of N pushes. The ring
//                 + barrier + single-summed-output STRUCTURE is Warren
//                 Pratt's from aamix.c; the per-slice gain / pan / mute
//                 semantics and the anti-click gain ramp are
//                 NereusSDR-original. Three divergences from the
//                 upstream structure are argued in MasterMixer.h.
//                 Authored by J.J. Boyd (KG4VCF), with AI-assisted
//                 transformation via Anthropic Claude Code.
//   2026-07-27 -- Replaced the stall-demotion heuristic with the explicit
//                 leave that upstream uses. A member is now withdrawn
//                 only by setSliceStreaming(false) or removeSlice(), so
//                 a slice that is merely late can no longer be mistaken
//                 for one that has stopped. Fixes the ANAN-G2E bench
//                 defect where two pans produced scratchy, robotic audio.

//   2026-07-27 -- Ported the master up-slew across a membership change.
//                 The raised-cosine window is Warren Pratt's from
//                 create_aaslew (aamix.c:86-92), armed where open_mixer
//                 raises slew.uflag (aamix.c:494-496), and its 10 ms
//                 length is the RX mixer's own tslewup from
//                 cmaster.c:297-313. Fixes the ANAN-G2E bench report of a
//                 "kerplunk at the end of the unkey": a slice re-admitted
//                 after MOX resumed at full amplitude in one sample.
//                 Down-slew is NOT ported; see divergence 4 below.

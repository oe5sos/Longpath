    // The values in this table are currently the last row — Thetis's client
    // policy — inherited wholesale because until 2026-07-25 every citation here
    // pointed at Thetis client code and none at hardware.
    //
    // Two consequences worth keeping in mind before trusting these numbers:
    //
    //   1. NR is a compile-time Verilog constant that CHANGES BETWEEN FIRMWARE
    //      RELEASES — shipped as 2, 4, 7 and 8 at different times on the same
    //      board. So no static per-board integer can be correct for every
    //      firmware a user might be running. The durable fix is to cap by what
    //      the radio actually answers (a DDC that never delivers packets is
    //      absent) rather than by a compiled-in table.
    //   2. The usable count is RATE-DEPENDENT, because aggregate I/Q throughput
    //      is link-bound (P2 I/Q is 24-bit I+Q = 6 bytes/sample). Eight
    //      receivers at 192 kHz and two at 1536 kHz are the same hardware.
    //      A single integer cannot express that.
    //
    // Deliberate decision 2026-07-25: hold the ceiling at 5 and get Phase 3F
    // working there first, then revisit raising it toward NR once multi-slice is
    // proven on a bench. Do NOT raise these values without either gateware
    // evidence for the specific SKU or a probe against real hardware.

    // per-SKU PureSignal / diversity reservations. On 2-ADC P2 boards

    // The per-board codec's stream-to-DDC table must agree (for example

    //
    // Design doc §2 "Resolved values per SKU" has been treated as the authority
    // here, but note that the design doc is itself derived from Thetis, so it
    // carries Thetis's client policy rather than hardware truth — the same
    // caveat as maxSlices above. Where a SKU's value is contested, gateware or a
    // hardware probe outranks both the design doc and Thetis.

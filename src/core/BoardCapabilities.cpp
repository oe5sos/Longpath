//   (Setup.cs:1084-1088 PerformDelayedInitialisation, :16085-16086 udHermesStepAttenuatorData)
//   NOTE: mi0bot widens the upper bound to +32 at runtime (console.cs:11043

//   off-by-one upstream bug — wire encoding `31 - userDb` (console.cs:11075)
//   produces wire = -1 at userDb=32 which 6-bit-masks to 0x3F, the same
//   wire value the chip would interpret as max-LNA-gain wraparound, NOT
//   "32 dB attenuation".  mi0bot's own InitConsole at console.cs:2111
//   sets Max=31 (chip-correct).  NereusSDR caps at +31 per maintainer
//   approval (issue #175 follow-up bench finding).

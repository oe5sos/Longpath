// src/core/dsp/Notch.h  (NereusSDR)
// =================================================================
//
// Ported from Thetis Project Files/Source/Console/radio.cs [v2.10.3.15]
// (commit 3759d096), class MNotch at radio.cs:4328-4360.
//
// Modification history (NereusSDR):
//   2026-07-29  J.J. Boyd / KG4VCF  TNF Task 2. The three-field shape
//                 (FCenter / FWidth / Active) is carried over from
//                 MNotch as centerHz / widthHz / active. MNotch's logic
//                 is deliberately NOT ported: Parse / ToString exist to
//                 fit Thetis's key-value database and NereusSDR persists
//                 flat AppSettings keys instead (design section 5.5),
//                 and CompareTo has no NereusSDR caller. The `id` field
//                 has no Thetis counterpart; Thetis identifies a notch
//                 by its position in MNotchDB, which is why every Thetis
//                 mutation loses the operator's selection and recovers
//                 it by searching for matching field values (design
//                 section 5.2). Default width 200 Hz is the panadapter
//                 width from console.cs:40268 [v2.10.3.15]; the
//                 authoritative named constant lives on NotchModel.
//                 AI-assisted transformation via Anthropic Claude Code.

namespace Longpath {

/// One manual notch, in absolute RF Hz.
///
/// Handed between NotchModel (the owner), RxChannel (the WDSP fan-out) and
/// SpectrumWidget (the marker layer). It lives in core/ rather than models/ so
/// RxChannel can take it by const reference without core acquiring a dependency
/// on models; same placement rationale as dsp/ChannelConfig.h.
///
/// **Field-set provenance.** centerHz / widthHz / active correspond to the three
/// fields of Thetis's MNotch class in radio.cs (FCenter / FWidth / Active). None
/// of MNotch's logic is carried over: its Parse / ToString round-trip exists to
/// fit Thetis's key-value database and NereusSDR persists flat AppSettings keys
/// instead, and its CompareTo has no NereusSDR caller. `id` has no Thetis
/// counterpart at all; Thetis identifies a notch by its position in MNotchDB,
/// which is why every Thetis mutation loses the operator's selection and has to
/// recover it by searching for matching field values.
///
/// **Default width.** 200 Hz is the width Thetis gives a notch created from the
/// panadapter. The authoritative named constant lives on NotchModel; the
/// initialiser here mirrors it so a default-constructed Notch is usable.

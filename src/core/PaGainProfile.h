// Modification history (NereusSDR):
//   2026-05-03 — Reimplemented in C++20/Qt6 for NereusSDR by J.J. Boyd
//                 (KG4VCF), with AI-assisted transformation via Anthropic
//                 Claude Code. Phase 1 Agent 1A of issue #167 PA-cal
//                 safety hotfix (K2GX field report — drive-slider math
//                 without per-band PA gain compensation produced >300 W
//                 output on a 200 W ANAN-8000DLE). Pure factory-table
//                 free functions; no UI / no persistence / no controller
//                 wiring (those land in Phase 2/3 of the same plan via
//                 PaProfile + PaProfileManager + TransmitModel).

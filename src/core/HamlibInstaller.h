//
// NereusSDR-original.
//
// Find Hamlib, say what is there, and install it if the operator asks.
//
// The rotator link needs rotctld, which comes from Hamlib, which is not
// part of this program. Until now the answer to "Hamlib is not
// installed" was a sentence telling the operator to open a terminal.
// That is the point where a feature stops being used.
//
// What this will and will not do, and why the line is where it is:
//
//   It runs `brew install hamlib`, and only that. Homebrew is the
//   operator's own package manager, installing from their own configured
//   taps; the command is shown in full before it runs and its output is
//   shown while it runs. Nothing is downloaded by this program, and no
//   URL is fetched.
//
//   It never uses sudo, and there is a test that says so. A program that
//   asks for an administrator password to install an optional extra has
//   asked for far more than it needs, and an operator who types the
//   password into a dialog like that has learned a habit worth not
//   teaching. Homebrew installs into a prefix the user already owns.
//
//   Where there is no Homebrew — Linux, or macOS without it — this shows
//   the exact command for the platform and stops. Those need sudo, so
//   they are the operator's to run.
//
// The other half is knowing what is installed. Hamlib's model numbers
// move between releases, so `rotctl --list` is read and the operator's
// chosen number checked against it. Picking 404 on a Hamlib too old to
// have the ERC driver otherwise fails as "rotctld exited", which reads
// as a broken cable rather than as a wrong number.

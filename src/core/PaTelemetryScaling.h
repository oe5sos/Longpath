// Modification history (NereusSDR):
//   2026-05-03 — Reimplemented in C++20/Qt6 for NereusSDR by J.J. Boyd
//                 (KG4VCF), with AI-assisted transformation via Anthropic
//                 Claude Code.
//                 Phase 1 Agent 1B of issue #167 PA calibration safety
//                 hotfix.  Lifts scaleFwdPowerWatts out of
//                 src/models/RadioModel.cpp (private file-scope helper) into
//                 a public free-function API, plus adds the new
//                 scaleFwdRevVoltage companion needed to drive the
//                 PaValuesPage FWD voltage / REV voltage / Raw FWD power
//                 readout labels.
//                 Callsite migration deferred to Phase 4 Agent 4A; the
//                 RadioModel.cpp private copy is intentionally retained
//                 here so this commit is a non-breaking ADD (not a
//                 refactor).

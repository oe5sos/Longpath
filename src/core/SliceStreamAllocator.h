// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original policy class. The window-fit rule
// ports Thetis console.cs:31913-31925 [v2.10.3.15]; the stream topology
// mirrors ChannelMaster cmaster.h:75-82 (one _rcvr drives cmMAXSubRcvr
// channels off one I/Q input). Thetis has no equivalent allocator
// because it hard-codes RX1 -> DDC2 and RX2 -> DDC3; NereusSDR
// allocates across every user DDC the SKU has.

// Request microphone permission on macOS at app startup.
//
// Hardened-Runtime + Developer-ID signed apps with NSMicrophoneUsageDescription
// in Info.plist will normally surface the system permission dialog the first
// time something opens an input audio unit. In practice that's unreliable for
// us: AudioEngine::ensureTxInputOpen() drives Pa_OpenStream through PortAudio's
// CoreAudio backend, and the device resolver silently returns paNoDevice on
// machines that lack a built-in mic (Mac mini / Mac Studio) or whose only
// inputs are audio interfaces with names that don't match the hardware-mic
// regex. When that happens, AVCaptureDevice never sees an access attempt and
// macOS has no reason to show the prompt.
//
// Calling AVCaptureDevice's requestAccess(forMediaType:AVMediaTypeAudio) at
// app launch deterministically engages TCC regardless of what audio hardware
// is attached, so the user gets the prompt on first launch and the answer is
// cached for every subsequent mic open. No-op on non-macOS platforms.

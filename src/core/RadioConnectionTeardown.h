// src/core/RadioConnectionTeardown.h
//
// Shared helper for tearing down a RadioConnection that lives on its
// own worker QThread. Used by RadioModel during disconnect / shutdown
// and by the regression test tst_cross_thread_teardown.
//
// Why this exists: P1RadioConnection and P2RadioConnection create
// QTimers inside init(), which runs on the worker thread after
// moveToThread(). Those timers are thread-affined to the worker.
// If the main thread destroys the RadioConnection directly after
// joining the worker, each child QTimer's destructor calls killTimer
// on the wrong thread — Qt prints "Timers cannot be stopped from
// another thread" and on Windows the process can terminate abnormally
// during cleanup.
//
// The correct pattern, captured here: post the protocol disconnect()
// onto the worker via QueuedConnection, then wait on a semaphore that
// the lambda releases when it finishes. main waits up to a timeout
// for that release before calling quit() / wait() / terminate(). The
// lambda also schedules the connection's self-deletion via
// deleteLater(), which Qt processes on the worker as part of the
// event-loop shutdown sequence — so the destructor (and its child
// QTimer destructors) runs on the worker thread, where the timers
// live, and no cross-thread warnings fire.
//
// Issue #83: an earlier version used a plain QueuedConnection
// invokeMethod for both disconnect() AND deleteLater(), relying on
// "Qt will drain the posted events during quit()". On Windows the
// event dispatcher's interrupt path races the queued MetaCall: quit()
// exited the loop before the disconnect lambda was dispatched. On
// HL2 close that left the UDP socket open, metis-stop unsent, three
// timers alive, and the RadioConnection object orphaned with its
// thread gone — the process then crashed during later static-dtor
// cleanup and left the Winsock endpoint in a state that prevented
// Thetis from binding port 51188 on the next session until a reboot
// / `netsh winsock reset`.
//
// PR #108 review (Codex) flagged a follow-on concern with the first
// fix attempt (which used Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection): if the
// worker is stuck inside its own onReadyRead loop (which drains UDP
// datagrams in an unbounded `while (hasPendingDatagrams())`), the
// blocking call would never return and the UI thread would hang
// indefinitely on shutdown — there'd be no way to fall through to
// the existing wait(timeout) + terminate fallback. The semaphore
// pattern keeps the synchronization (we still know the lambda ran
// before we quit) while bounding the worst-case shutdown latency at
// kDispatchTimeoutMs + kPostQuitWaitMs.
//
// The semaphore is held via std::shared_ptr so a late-firing lambda
// after the dispatch timeout doesn't touch a destroyed object.
//
// Both pointer references are set to nullptr on return; the QThread
// container itself is main-thread-owned and safe to delete from the
// caller, which this helper does.

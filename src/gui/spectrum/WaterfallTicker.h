//
// Dedicated worker-thread ticker for waterfall row pushes.  Isolates
// the timer from main-thread state so a momentarily-busy GUI thread
// can no longer delay the push cadence.
//
// Bench symptom 2026-05-25 KG4VCF: even after PreciseTimer + push-
// timer + thread-priority elevation, the waterfall scroll still had
// occasional ~1 Hz stutters.  Diagnosis pointed at main-thread
// availability: the PreciseTimer was firing on the main thread, so
// any main-thread delay (focus event, layout pass, etc.) delayed
// the push by the same amount.
//
// This class lives on its own QThread.  The QTimer fires there.
// Each tick emits tick() as an auto-queued signal to the consumer
// (SpectrumWidget) on the main thread.  The consumer's queued slot
// processes the next time the main thread reaches its event loop;
// no individual paint, layout, or signal can delay the timer's
// internal cadence, so multiple delayed tickets queue up and drain
// in a burst when the main thread frees -- visibly cleaner than a
// long pause followed by a single push.
//
// API:
//   * setUpdatePeriodMs(int)  -- thread-safe; reschedules the timer.
//   * start() / stop()        -- thread-safe; starts/stops the timer.
//   * tick()                  -- signal, fires on worker thread.
//
// The ticker does NOT own waterfall texture state -- that stays on
// the main thread.  This is the timing-isolation half of "Option A";
// the texture-isolation half is a separate refactor (see notes in
// design doc).

/// Owns the banner's item table and applies one fold decision per resize.

///   1. Nothing shrinks. An item is at its natural width or hidden.
///   2. Widths are cached, never re-measured mid-decision.
///   3. One pass per relayout. No second look, no feedback.
///
/// Two independent axes decide an item's visibility, both owned here:
///   - FOLD, computed internally from width pressure (the rung ladder).
///   - AVAILABILITY, an external fact a caller reports via
///     setItemAvailable (PS-A armed, TGXL present, a second ADC chain,
///     an RX pill's DSP-active state). An item is visible only when
///     BOTH hold: available && !folded. This closes the gap Task A8's
///     first round left: several banner items already have a legitimate
///     second visibility owner (their feature's own on/armed/present
///     state), and this class's addItem contract requires it to be the
///     SOLE writer of setVisible. Before this axis existed, the only way
///     to reconcile the two was an external caller ANDing a live query
///     on top of relayout()'s decision after the fact, which cannot see
///     signals that fire between relayout() calls and does not adjust
///     the WIDTH budget for an item that is currently unavailable
///     (Task A8 fix round 1 findings 1 and 2). availability is a stored
///     input, not a live read, so it cannot introduce the
///     measure-mutate-measure oscillation this whole design exists to
///     remove: it only changes when a caller explicitly says so.

// RxDspWorker runs the per-receiver I/Q → WDSP → audio processing step
// on a dedicated DSP thread, off the GUI main thread.
//
// Why: WDSP's fexchange2() (called via RxChannel::processIq) is opened
// with bfo=1, which makes it block on Sem_OutReady whenever the WDSP
// channel's internal DSP loop hasn't replenished its output ring. When
// that call ran on the GUI main thread it produced a deterministic
// two-way deadlock: fexchange2 waited on Sem_OutReady, the WDSP worker
// (wdspmain) waited on Sem_BuffReady, and because the main thread was
// blocked the Qt event loop stopped delivering more I/Q events to feed
// fexchange2 — so wdspmain never received another input batch and never
// signalled Sem_OutReady. Moving fexchange2 to its own thread keeps the
// blocking semantics local to that thread and lets the GUI event loop
// keep dispatching I/Q events.
//
// The worker is owned by RadioModel. It is constructed on the main
// thread, given non-owning WdspEngine/AudioEngine pointers via
// setEngines(), moved to RadioModel::m_dspThread, then driven by a
// Qt::QueuedConnection from ReceiverManager::iqDataForReceiver.

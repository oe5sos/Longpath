    //
    // A stream is one hardware DDC plus its ReceiverManager receiver, its
    // FFTEngine, its panadapter window, and its noise blanker. Streams are
    // opened once at connect and reused, mirroring Thetis CreateRadio
    // (cmaster.cs:516 [v2.10.3.15]) and deskhpsdr's create-all loop
    // (radio.c:1259 [@f3d857c]). Neither upstream opens a WDSP channel at
    // runtime.
    //
    // Slices bind many-to-one: several whose frequencies fall inside one
    // window share it, differing only by shift offset. An idle stream costs
    // memory; its DDC stays out of the ddcEnable bitmask so the radio never
    // streams it.

    /// honoured. The clamp is the collision guard: WDSP's channel table is one
    /// global array (channel.c:29) and OpenChannel overwrites whatever sits at
    /// the id without closing it, so a pool that ran past kMaxSliceChannels
    /// would silently take over kTxChannelId and orphan the TXA's thread. A SKU
    /// that wants a bigger pool has to raise the reserved block, which moves TX
    /// and PS with it.

# Issue #263 — ANAN-10E / Hermes-class P2 Connection Verification

> **Status:** Bench matrix drafted; awaiting verification on real
> hardware (ANAN-10E with community Protocol 2 gateware).
>
> Reporter: nubbyless (issue #263). Symptom: NereusSDR detects the
> radio, shows "Connected" for a few seconds, then disconnects.
> Works fine in Thetis and [another client].
>
> Root cause: `P2RadioConnection::connectToRadio` and
> `P2CodecOrionMkII::applyPureSignalDdcConfig` only carried the
> G2-class (2-ADC) branch of `Thetis console.cs UpdateDDCs()`. On
> the wire, NereusSDR was telling a 1-ADC HermesII board to "enable
> DDC2", which that gateware does not stream. The 2 s connect
> watchdog fired and the connection dropped. The fix ports the
> HermesII (8451-8521) and Hermes (8378-8449) branches of
> UpdateDDCs into the P2 codec, picks the per-board primary DDC at
> connection time, and routes the receiver-to-DDC mapping in
> RadioModel accordingly.

## How to use

1. Build: `cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && cmake --build build`.
2. Launch: `open build/NereusSDR.app` (macOS) / run `build/NereusSDR` (Linux/Win).
3. For each row below, perform the described action against the test radio,
   confirm the expected result, attach packet captures + screenshots to
   the PR thread when applicable.

| # | Radio | Action | Expected | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ANAN-10E** (1-ADC HermesII, community P2 gateware) | Discover + Connect | Connection holds. Spectrum + waterfall display real I/Q. No "connect watchdog fired" log line. | This is the issue-#263 regression case. User-submitted support bundle confirms 2 s watchdog timeout pre-fix with `I/Q packets: 0` on every disconnect. Should pass post-fix. |
| 2 | ANAN-10E | Tune VFO across 80m, 40m, 20m, 15m, 10m | Spectrum re-centers; signal strength changes per band. Alex HPF/LPF bits update on each tune (visible via `setAntennaRouting` log). | Validates `setReceiverFrequency` writes to DDC0 (the new primary), not DDC2. |
| 3 | ANAN-10E | Cycle sample rate 48 / 96 / 192 kHz | Each rate accepted, spectrum bandwidth updates, no disconnect. | `setSampleRate` writes `m_rx[0].samplingRate`; was previously hardcoded on `m_rx[2]` indirectly. |
| 4 | ANAN-10E | Connect / Disconnect / Reconnect 3x | Each cycle clean; no `m_rx[2]` stale state confuses the second connect. | `m_rx[primaryDdc].frequency == 0` guard now keys off the right slot. |
| 5 | ANAN-10E | PCAP the P2 CmdRx packet during steady-state RX. Verify byte 7 = 0x01 (DDC0 enabled), byte 18-19 = wire rate (192/96/48), byte 30-31 = 0 (DDC2 rate unused). | Wire matches Thetis P2 wire for the same radio. | Compare against a Thetis pcap from the same radio if available. |
| 6 | ANAN-100B (1-ADC HermesII, same gateware family) | Connect | Connection holds; same per-band tune behavior. | Same code path as ANAN-10E; if available, exercises the second SKU on the HermesII branch. |
| 7 | **ANAN-10 / ANAN-100** (1-ADC Hermes-class, community P2 gateware) | Connect | Connection holds; DDC0 primary as per Thetis console.cs:8378-8449. | Exercises the new `psDdcConfigHermesClass` P2 branch. May be theoretical — community P2 firmware for Hermes is rare. |
| 8 | **ANAN-G2** (2-ADC OrionMkII/Saturn) | Connect + cycle modes (LSB/USB/CW/AM/FM) | Behavior unchanged from v0.5.1. RX1 on DDC2 as before. | Regression check — the G2 branch was factored into `psDdcConfigG2Class` byte-identically. The existing `tst_p2_regression_freeze` test locks this against the pre-refactor JSON baseline. |
| 9 | ANAN-G2 | PureSignal MOX TX | PS still works as in v0.5.1. | Regression check on the G2 PS-MOX path. |
| 10 | ANAN-10E | PureSignal MOX TX (if user has PS-capable wiring) | **DEFERRED / OBSERVATIONAL.** Codec emits Thetis-source-faithful bytes (`cntrl1=4` for HermesII PS-MOX). Whether the community gateware honors them is unverified. Capture wire bytes; if a future bench shows divergence, add an empirical override mirroring the 2026-05-09 P1 fix in `P1CodecStandard.cpp::psDdcConfigHermesIIClass`. | The P1 wire-observed `cntrl1=0` override does NOT mechanically apply to P2: P1 wire reads `P1_adc_cntrl` (separate variable, networkproto1.c:519), while P2 wire reads `prn->rx[i].rx_adc` which IS the path SetADC_cntrl1 writes. So Thetis P2 wire = source value. Detailed rationale in inline comment in `P2CodecOrionMkII.cpp::psDdcConfigHermesIIClass`. |
| 11 | ANAN-10E | Disconnect via radio power-off (not via UI) | Connection ends; auto-reconnect armed; reconnect resumes cleanly when radio comes back up. | No DDC2-vs-DDC0 confusion across the auto-reconnect path. |

## P1 port-fidelity fix (rolled into the same PR)

The diagnostic work for issue #263 surfaced a second port-fidelity bug
on the **P1** side: NereusSDR P1 codecs were reading bank 4 C1/C2 wire
bytes from `cfg.cntrl1` (a value Thetis UpdateDDCs computes and maps
to `prn->rx[i].rx_adc` for the P2 wire), while Thetis P1 reads them
from `P1_adc_cntrl` — a separate variable set only by SetADC_cntrl_P1
when the user touches the Setup form's per-DDC ADC radio buttons.

The fix adds:

- `CodecContext::p1AdcCntrl` field (the Thetis `P1_adc_cntrl` mirror).
- `P1RadioConnection::m_p1AdcCntrl` field + `setP1AdcCntrl(int)` slot.
- Board-aware default in `applyBoardQuirks()`:
  - HermesLite (HL2): `0x04` (Thetis fresh-install default; matches
    every working HL2 PS configuration).
  - 2-ADC boards (Angelia / Orion / OrionMkII / Saturn / G2-class):
    `0x04` (Thetis fresh-install default).
  - Hermes / HermesII (other 1-ADC): `0x00` (matches wire observed on
    working ANAN-10E P1 during PS-MOX on 2026-05-09).
- Per-MAC AppSettings override at `hardware/<mac>/p1AdcCntrl` (read by
  RadioModel after applyBoardQuirks runs at connect time).
- P1 codec subclasses (`P1CodecStandard`, `P1CodecHl2`) read bank 4
  C1/C2 from `ctx.p1AdcCntrl`, not `ctx.adcCtrl`. AnvelinaPro3 and
  RedPitaya inherit Standard's bank 4 path.
- The 2026-05-09 `cfg.cntrl1=0` empirical override in
  `P1CodecStandard::psDdcConfigHermesIIClass` is reverted — that
  override was patching the NereusSDR-side conflation (cfg.cntrl1
  reaching the P1 wire). With the wire byte now correctly sourced
  from `m_p1AdcCntrl`, cfg.cntrl1 reverts to the source-faithful
  Thetis value (`4`) and no longer affects the P1 wire.

The Setup → Hardware → P1 ADC Routing page (Thetis's 21 radDDC*ADC*
radio buttons) is **deferred to a follow-up issue**; today's defaults
cover every observed working configuration. Users with a genuine need
to override can edit `hardware/<mac>/p1AdcCntrl` in
`~/.config/NereusSDR/NereusSDR.settings`.

### P1 verification rows

| # | Radio | Action | Expected | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-1 | **HL2 (Hermes Lite 2)** | Connect + RX | Behavior unchanged from v0.5.1. PS-MOX still works. | HL2 default `m_p1AdcCntrl=4` matches Thetis fresh-install + pre-refactor wire byte. Regression check. |
| P1-2 | **ANAN-10 / ANAN-100** (Hermes, P1) | Connect + RX | Behavior unchanged from v0.5.1. | 1-ADC Hermes default `m_p1AdcCntrl=0` (NereusSDR pre-refactor also emitted 0 for non-MOX). |
| P1-3 | **ANAN-10E / 100B** (HermesII, P1) | Connect + RX | Behavior unchanged from v0.5.1. PS-MOX still works. | HermesII default `m_p1AdcCntrl=0` matches the 2026-05-09 empirical override result. Same wire byte as before. |
| P1-4 | **ANAN-100D** (Angelia, P1 2-ADC) | Connect + RX | Wire byte changes: bank 4 C1 = 4 (was 0 pre-refactor). | This is the **intended port-fidelity correction** for 2-ADC P1 boards. Default now matches Thetis fresh-install (`rx_adc_ctrl_P1 = 4`). Users who relied on the old 0 value can override via AppSettings. |
| P1-5 | **ANAN-200D / 7000D / 8000D / G2** (P1 path; rare but possible) | Connect + RX | Same as P1-4 — bank 4 C1 = 4 (was 0). | Same port-fidelity correction; all 2-ADC P1 paths align with Thetis. |
| P1-6 | AppSettings override | Set `hardware/<mac>/p1AdcCntrl` to `0x14` via direct XML edit. Reconnect. | `p1AdcCntrl` log line at connect shows `0x14`; bank 4 C1 = 0x14 on the wire. | Validates the per-MAC override path that the future Setup UI will use. |

## Build / unit test status (already verified before bench)

- `tst_codec_ps_ddc_config`: 35 cases pass, including 9 new HermesII / Hermes P2 wire-byte assertions.
- `tst_p2_codec_orionmkii`: unchanged, all pass.
- `tst_p2_codec_saturn`: unchanged, all pass.
- `tst_p2_regression_freeze`: pre-refactor Saturn/Orion/OrionMkII byte-for-byte baseline still locks; G2 branch was factored without semantic change.

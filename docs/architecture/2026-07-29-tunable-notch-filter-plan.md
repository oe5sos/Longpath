# Tunable Notch Filter Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (recommended) or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task by task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship an operator-placed tunable notch filter: click a carrier on the panadapter, a narrow slot is cut out of the received audio, and it stays cut across retunes, band changes, reconnects and restarts.

**Architecture:** A single global `NotchModel` on `RadioModel` holds the canonical notch list in absolute RF Hz. `RadioModel` mirrors it into every live `RxChannel`'s WDSP notch database, each channel also receiving its hosting DDC stream's centre frequency so WDSP can map absolute notches into that channel's baseband. `SpectrumWidget` renders markers and raises interaction signals per pan; the model is shared, the pixel mapping is per-pan.

**Tech Stack:** C++20, Qt6 (Widgets, Test), WDSP (vendored TAPR v1.29, `nbp.c` NBP notch API), AppSettings XML persistence, CMake + Ninja, Qt Test.

**Design authority:** [`docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md`](2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md). Adversarial review that shaped it: [`2026-07-28-tnf-spec-adversarial-review.md`](2026-07-28-tnf-spec-adversarial-review.md). Where this plan and the spec disagree, the spec wins; report the conflict rather than silently choosing.

## Global Constraints

Every task's requirements implicitly include this section.

**Upstream stamps.** Thetis `v2.10.3.15` (`3759d096`) at `/Users/j.j.boyd/Thetis`. mi0bot-Thetis `@c26a8a4`. AetherSDR `@c6481cbf` at `/Users/j.j.boyd/AetherSDR`. WDSP vendored at `third_party/wdsp/src/`. Cite ported logic inline as `// From Thetis <file>:<line> [v2.10.3.15]` or `// From AetherSDR <file>:<line> [@c6481cbf]`.

**Source first.** Never invent a signature, constant, line number or API. Open the upstream file, read it, port it. If you cannot find the source, stop and ask.

**Attribution is ship-blocking.** `NotchModel.{h,cpp}` is a new attribution event and needs the AetherSDR block plus **both** Thetis headers (`radio.cs` and `console.cs`) byte for byte, `// --- From <file> ---` separated, plus PROVENANCE rows, in the commit that introduces it. See design §10.1. Author tags inside ported ranges must survive verbatim, including `//NOTCH MW0LGE` (`console.cs:33283`); see design §10.3. `SpectrumOverlayPanel.{h,cpp}` must receive **no** Thetis cite (design §10.2).

**Style.** Classes `PascalCase`, methods and variables `camelCase`, constants `kPascalCase`, members `m_camelCase`. Braces on all control flow. No raw `new`/`delete`. No `goto`. No `QSettings`, use `AppSettings`. Log with `qCWarning`, never throw. Platform guards use `Q_OS_*`.

**Commits.** GPG-signed. No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer. No em-dash characters in commit messages, comments, or documentation.

**Build and test.**

```bash
cmake --build build --target tst_notch_model_guards -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) && ctest --test-dir build -R tst_notch_model_guards --output-on-failure
```

Build only the target you need. A full suite build costs roughly 32 minutes; see `docs/development/fast-test-loop.md`.

### Line numbers: locate by symbol, not by line

**The base changed after this plan was written.** It now sits on `main`
after PR #312 merged `feature/nereussdr-multipan`, which is 189 files and
roughly 28k lines beyond the integration base the plan was authored
against. Upstream cites (Thetis, AetherSDR, WDSP) are unaffected, since
those trees are pinned. **NereusSDR line numbers in this plan and in the
design spec are advisory.** Locate every in-tree anchor by grepping its
symbol, and update the cite to the line you actually find.

Re-verified anchors, as of this base:

| Symbol | Spec/plan says | Actually at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setShiftFrequency(placement.shiftOffsetHz)` in `bindSliceToStream` | `RadioModel.cpp:3676` | **`:4110`** |
| `activateSliceChannel` early return | `RadioModel.cpp:3119` | **`:3179`** |
| `openRxChannelPool` | `RadioModel.cpp:3068` | **`:3083`** |
| `activateBoundSliceChannels()` call | `RadioModel.cpp:3068` | **`:3118`** |
| `wireSliceSignals` slice-frequency seed | `RadioModel.cpp:9206` | **`:9904`** |
| `updateShiftFrequency` lambda | `RadioModel.cpp:8966-8988` | **`:9669`** |
| `RadioModel::rxNf` TCI stub | `RadioModel.cpp:11412` | **`:12454`** |
| `spotModel()` accessor | `RadioModel.h:768` | **`:967`** |
| `RxChannel::setShiftFrequency` | `RxChannel.cpp:1468` | **`:1448`** |
| `RXANBPSetShiftFrequency` call site | `RxChannel.cpp:1483` | **`:1463`** |
| `RXANBPSetShiftFrequency` decl | `wdsp_api.h:357` | `:357` (unchanged) |
| `MnfSetupPage` ctor | `DspSetupPages.cpp:2110` | **`:2143`** |
| `registerPage(dsp, "MNF", ...)` | `SetupDialog.cpp:609` | **`:610`** |
| `SpectrumOverlayPanel` MNF stub | `SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:273` | **`:276`** |
| `Placement::shiftOffsetHz` | `SliceStreamAllocator.h:48` | `:48` (unchanged) |

Re-confirmed on this base: `RXANBPSetTuneFrequency` still appears nowhere
in `src/` or `tests/`, so design §4's premise holds. The tag-preservation
check passes clean at 3441 cites.

## Normative cross-task corrections

These came out of a reconcile pass over the ten independently authored tasks. **They override the task bodies below.** Apply each when you reach the task named.

### Hard errors

1. **`tst_notch_hit_test` must be registered exactly once.** Tasks 6 and 7 both register it. Two `add_executable()` calls with one target name is a CMake configure failure. **Task 6 creates and registers the file; Task 7 appends test slots only and registers nothing.**
2. **Persistence is never triggered as written.** Task 3 produces `restoreFromSettings()` and `saveToSettings()`; no task calls either. **Task 4 constructs `NotchModel` and calls `restoreFromSettings()` in the `RadioModel` constructor. Task 3 makes every mutator save-on-mutate** (matching how `SliceModel` persists), and says so in its Produces.
3. **`RxChannel::m_notchAutoIncrease` defaults to `{true}`**, not `{false}`. WDSP creates nbp0 with `1, // auto-increase notch width` (`RXA.c:105`). A `{false}` carry plus Task 4's unconditional reconcile silently disables it on every channel and fails bench row 8. **Task 2 owns this member and both notch carries, written outside `#ifdef HAVE_WDSP`. Task 4 declares neither.**

### Duplicated declarations, single owner

4. `NotchModel::visualEnabled` / `setVisualEnabled` / `visualEnabledChanged` and the `NotchVisualEnabled` key: **Task 3 owns.** Task 10 consumes; it keeps only `SpectrumWidget::setVisualNotchEnabled` and the `chkVisualNotch` binding.
5. The five `SpectrumWidget` notch signals plus `m_selectedNotchId` / `m_hoveredNotchId`: **Task 6 owns** (its colour logic reads both). Task 7 consumes, and produces only `NotchGrab`, `m_notchGrab`, the drag anchors and the hit-test seams.
6. Bounds constants: **`NotchModel` owns** `kMaxNotchWidthHz = 10000.0`, `kMinNotchCentreHz = 100000.0`, `kMaxNotchCentreHz = 61440000.0`. Task 9 keeps only `kMnfWidthMinHz` and `kMnfWidthStepHz`; Task 7 uses `NotchModel::kMaxNotchWidthHz`. `SpectrumWidget.cpp:125` already includes `models/BandPlanManager.h`, so the gui-to-models include is established.
7. Width clamping lives **only** in `NotchModel::setWidth`. Task 7's wheel handler is a bare `setWidth(id, current + delta * step)` with no second clamp.
8. `notchSpecRect()` (Task 7) is the **single** geometry source; Task 6's two paint sites call it, so hit boxes cannot drift from drawn markers.

### Naming

9. Task 6 uses `NotchModel::kDefaultNotchWidthHz` and `kNarrowNotchWidthHz` (Task 3's names). Task 3 does not rename.
10. **Unit boundary, declare it and honour it:** `NotchMarker::freqMhz` is MHz. Everything else, `NotchModel::centerHz`, all five `notch*Requested` signals, `setNotchMinWidthHz`, and the dent maths, is **Hz**. `MainWindow::refreshPanNotchMarkers` is the only conversion site.
11. Task 4 cites `RXA.c:87` (master run) and `RXA.c:105` (autoincr), not `:86` / `:103`.

### Missing wiring to add

12. **`RxChannel::minNotchWidthHz()` must reach `SpectrumWidget::setNotchMinWidthHz()`.** Without it the widget keeps a hardcoded 100.0 forever, which feeds Task 7's edge-drag clamp and Task 10's dent span. **Task 10 owns this wiring**, alongside a `minNotchWidthChanged(double)` signal driven from `setFilterSizeSamples` / `setSampleRate` so bench row 7 can pass.
13. **Task 8 registers a test.** Suggest `tst_tnf_ui_wiring`, covering the accelerator and the menu two-way sync.
14. **Task 8 names its `+TNF` click slot** and either reuses `MainWindow::onNotchCreateRequested(double, bool)` (Task 6) or declares a distinct member.
15. **Task 8 states explicitly that it deletes the disabled `MNF` stub at `SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:273-278`**, keeping `+TNF` at index 1. Task 10 consumes that deletion.
16. Either wire `NotchModel::notchAddRejected` to a status message (Task 8) or drop it along with `notchNearFreq()` / `notchesInBandwidth()` / `notchSurrounding()`. As written a `+TNF` press inside the 10 Hz dedupe window is silently ignored with no operator feedback.

### Sequencing

17. Tasks 1, 2, 4 and 9 each add a forward declaration plus a `friend class ::TestX;` line to the same two `LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` blocks in `src/core/WdspEngine.h:100-124` and `:674-695`. Expect textual conflicts. Land them in task order and rebase rather than merging.

## Open decisions for the maintainer

These are user-visible defaults and attribution scope, which CLAUDE.md places outside autonomous change. **Resolve before Task 3 lands.**

| # | Decision | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D-a | `NotchModel::globalEnabled` default | **RESOLVED (JJ, 2026-07-29): `false`.** Matches Thetis (`chkTNF` ships unchecked) and WDSP (`create_notchdb` master run `0`, `RXA.c:87`). Task 3 sets the model default `false`; Task 6 sets `m_notchGlobalEnabled{false}` in the widget to match; Task 9's checkbox reflects it. Note the operator consequence: the first notch placed does nothing until the master switch is on, so Task 8's status-bar indicator must make the off state visible. |
| D-b | `NotchModel::autoIncrease` default | **RESOLVED: `true`.** Confirmed independently in both upstreams: WDSP creates nbp0 with `1, // auto-increase notch width` (`RXA.c:105`), and Thetis ships `chkMNFAutoIncrease.Checked = true` (`setup.designer.cs:44197`). Note the P/Invoke takes a bool (`dsp.cs:737`) while the C takes an int; our wrapper takes `bool` and converts at the boundary. |
| D-c | `NotchModel` attribution scope | **RESOLVED: keep three files, move the cite.** `NotchModel` carries the AetherSDR block plus `radio.cs` and `console.cs` only. The visual-notch default cite moves to `DspSetupPages.cpp`, which is already `setup.cs`-registered, so no fourth verbatim header is needed. The default itself is verified: `chkVisualNotch` has no `Checked` assignment anywhere (`setup.designer.cs:44169-44179`; only `AutoSize`, `Name`, `Text` and the handler hookup), so Windows Forms leaves it unchecked and `false` is correct. |
| D-d | `adminBusy` semantics | **RESOLVED: keep the flag, Task 9's reading is correct.** Thetis clears `AddActive` / `EditActive` before it writes (`setup.cs:17738-17768`), so the flag guards the panadapter path during the Settings-page edit window and never blocks the page's own commit. Design §9 and §5.4 are both accurate; the apparent contradiction is resolved by the clear-before-write ordering, which the task must reproduce. |
| D-e | Right-click on empty pan | **RESOLVED (JJ, 2026-07-29): add it to the existing popup.** Do not convert `SpectrumOverlayMenu` to a `QMenu`. It is a `QVBoxLayout` with section headers (`SpectrumOverlayMenu.cpp:19`, `:57` "Waterfall", `:110` "Spectrum"), so add a third section header "Notch" and an "Add notch here" button beneath it, styled from the same stylesheet block (`:37`, `:53`). Add a `notchAddRequested(double freqHz)` signal to `SpectrumOverlayMenu.h:54-62` and have `SpectrumWidget` pass the frequency under the cursor at popup time. **Task 7 owns this**, reversing its decision to drop the gesture. Note `SpectrumOverlayMenu` is AetherSDR-registered, not Thetis-registered, so the button carries no Thetis cite (same constraint as `SpectrumOverlayPanel`, Global Constraints). |
| D-f | TNF toggle accelerator | **RESOLVED: Ctrl+Shift+N**, as Task 8 proposed and verified unclaimed. Consistent with the existing Ctrl+Shift+S (Spot Hub) and Ctrl+Shift+R (FreeDV Reporter) chords. |

## 1. `RxChannel` (`src/core/RxChannel.h` 967 lines / `.cpp` 2301 lines)

### 1.1 Class declaration head (`RxChannel.h:218-249`, after ~215 lines of licence headers)

```cpp
#include "NbFamily.h"
#include "WdspTypes.h"
#include "dsp/ChannelConfig.h"
#include "dsp/RxChannelState.h"

#ifdef HAVE_DFNR
#include "DeepFilterFilter.h"
#endif

#ifdef HAVE_MNR
#include "MacNRFilter.h"
#endif

#include <QObject>

#include <atomic>
#include <cstring>
#include <memory>

namespace NereusSDR {

class WdspEngine;  // forward declaration for rebuild()

// Per-receiver WDSP channel wrapper.
// ...
class RxChannel : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT

    Q_PROPERTY(NereusSDR::DSPMode mode READ mode WRITE setMode NOTIFY modeChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(NereusSDR::AGCMode agcMode READ agcMode WRITE setAgcMode NOTIFY agcModeChanged)
    Q_PROPERTY(bool active READ isActive WRITE setActive NOTIFY activeChanged)

public:
    explicit RxChannel(int channelId, int bufferSize, int sampleRate,
                       QObject* parent = nullptr);
    ~RxChannel() override;

    int channelId() const { return m_channelId; }
    int bufferSize() const { return m_bufferSize; }
    int sampleRate() const { return m_sampleRate; }
```

Note: only three `Q_PROPERTY` declarations exist. The NR/AGC/notch surface is
plain C++ getters+setters, NOT Q_PROPERTY. Follow that. Do not add
`Q_PROPERTY` for notch state on `RxChannel`.

### 1.2 `setShiftFrequency` end to end, VERBATIM (`RxChannel.cpp:1464-1488`)

```cpp
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Frequency shift (pan offset from VFO)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

void RxChannel::setShiftFrequency(double offsetHz)
{
    if (offsetHz == m_shiftOffsetHz) {
        return;
    }

    m_shiftOffsetHz = offsetHz;

#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    if (std::abs(offsetHz) < 0.5) {
        // No offset ,  disable shift for efficiency
        SetRXAShiftRun(m_channelId, 0);
    } else {
        // From Thetis radio.cs:1417-1418 ,  both calls use the same sign
        SetRXAShiftFreq(m_channelId, offsetHz);
        RXANBPSetShiftFrequency(m_channelId, offsetHz);
        SetRXAShiftRun(m_channelId, 1);
    }
#else
    Q_UNUSED(offsetHz);
#endif
}
```

Declaration side (`RxChannel.h:615-617`):

```cpp
    // --- Frequency shift (for pan offset from VFO) ---

    void setShiftFrequency(double offsetHz);
```

Carry member (`RxChannel.h:936-938`):

```cpp
    // Shift offset carry (mirrors what was last passed to setShiftFrequency)
    double m_shiftOffsetHz{0.0};
```

Spec §4.3 requires this function be changed so `SetRXAShiftFreq` +
`RXANBPSetShiftFrequency` fire on BOTH branches and only `SetRXAShiftRun`
stays gated on magnitude, and the stale cite `radio.cs:1417-1418` becomes
`radio.cs:1419-1420 [v2.10.3.15]`.

### 1.3 NR setters, VERBATIM (`RxChannel.cpp:875-920`) ,  the canonical setter shape

```cpp
void RxChannel::setAnrTaps(int taps)
{
    m_nr1Tuning.taps = taps;
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis radio.cs:681-698 [v2.10.3.13]
    SetRXAANRTaps(m_channelId, taps);
#endif
}

void RxChannel::setAnrGain(double gain)
{
    m_nr1Tuning.gain = gain;
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis setup.cs:8545 [v2.10.3.13] ,  caller has already applied ×1e-6.
    // Passes raw WDSP-domain value directly to SetRXAANRGain.
    SetRXAANRGain(m_channelId, gain);
#endif
}

void RxChannel::setAnrPosition(NrPosition p)
{
    m_nr1Tuning.position = p;
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis setup.cs:8723 [v2.10.3.13]
    SetRXAANRPosition(m_channelId, static_cast<int>(p));
#endif
}
```

Struct-level setter that fans out to several WDSP calls
(`RxChannel.cpp:864-873`):

```cpp
void RxChannel::setAnrTuning(const Nr1Tuning& t)
{
    m_nr1Tuning = t;
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis radio.cs:681-698 [v2.10.3.13] ,  SetNRVals() calls
    // WDSP.SetRXAANRVals(id, taps, delay, gain, leak) with already-scaled values.
    SetRXAANRVals(m_channelId, t.taps, t.delay, t.gain, t.leakage);
    SetRXAANRPosition(m_channelId, static_cast<int>(t.position));
#endif
}
```

### 1.4 The `HAVE_WDSP` guard pattern (three variants in use, all in this file)

1. **Carry then guard** (dominant, use for notch setters):
   member write happens OUTSIDE the guard; WDSP calls inside.
   `#endif` with no `#else` when the parameter is consumed by the member write.
2. **Guard with `#else Q_UNUSED(x);`** when nothing outside the guard uses the
   argument (see `setBinauralEnabled`, `setShiftFrequency`).
3. **Guard with `#else` returning a stub value** for getters
   (e.g. `RxChannel.cpp:464-468`, `473-482`, `487-499`).

Spec §4.6 makes this load-bearing for TNF: `setNotchTuneFrequency` must set its
carry member outside `#ifdef HAVE_WDSP`, and expose `notchTuneFrequencyHz()`.

`RxChannel.cpp` includes at `:248-275`:

```cpp
#include "RxChannel.h"
#include "AppSettings.h"
#include "LogCategories.h"
#include "NbFamily.h"
#include "SampleRateCatalog.h"  // bufferSizeForRate() ,  for setSampleRate()
#include "WdspEngine.h"
#include "wdsp_api.h"
```

`wdsp_api.h` is included unconditionally; it self-guards internally.

### 1.5 Member naming and atomics

- Members are `m_camelCase`, brace-initialised with the default inline.
- `std::atomic<T>` is used ONLY for state the audio thread or the meter timer
  reads while the main thread writes. Verbatim examples (`RxChannel.h:850-887`):

```cpp
    std::atomic<double> m_afGain{1.0};
    std::atomic<bool> m_binauralEnabled{false};
    std::atomic<bool> m_active{false};
    // threshold default: From Thetis console.cs:45977 ,  agc_thresh_point = -20
    std::atomic<int> m_agcThreshold{-20};
    // ----- NR state (Sub-epic C-1) -----
    // From Thetis console.cs:43297-43450 SelectNR() [v2.10.3.13]
    std::atomic<NrSlot> m_activeNr{NrSlot::Off};
```

- Non-atomic plain members are used for state ONLY the main thread touches,
  with the reason stated in comment (`RxChannel.h:880-883`):

```cpp
    // Full tuning state per stage.  Written by the main thread under no lock
    // (struct setters copy by value; WDSP setters are the authoritative state
    // for the audio thread).
    Nr1Tuning m_nr1Tuning;
```

Notch carry state falls in the second category: WDSP owns the authoritative
notch DB; the C++ carry is main-thread only. Use plain members, not atomics,
and say so in a comment. Atomic accessors use explicit ordering where they were
added late: `m_activeNr.load(std::memory_order_acquire)`.

- Enum-class parameters are converted at the WDSP boundary with
  `static_cast<int>(x)`; booleans with `x ? 1 : 0`.
- Class-scope struct definitions (`Nr1Tuning` etc.) live in the public section
  with per-field defaults + a Thetis cite per field. Same shape for a `Notch`
  struct if one lands on `RxChannel`.

---

## 2. `src/core/wdsp_api.h` (1407 lines)

### 2.1 File structure

- `#pragma once` at `:239`, after a modification-history block (`:20-238`) and
  the four verbatim upstream licence headers.
- `#ifdef HAVE_WDSP` at `:255`, `extern "C" {` at `:257`, `} // extern "C"` at
  `:1343`, `#endif // HAVE_WDSP` at `:1345`.
- `#ifndef HAVE_WDSP` block `:1370-1407` holds stub-build constants only.
- **Every new declaration must be added inside the `extern "C"` block.**
- **Every batch of new declarations must also get a dated entry appended to the
  modification-history block** at the top, naming the author, the task, the
  upstream file + line range and the version stamp. That is an established,
  unbroken convention: 20+ entries, e.g.

```
//   2026-04-27 ,  SetTXAPanelGain1 added by J.J. Boyd (KG4VCF) during 3M-1b
//                 Task D.6 ,  TxChannel mic-mute path via setMicPreamp.
//                 Signature matches wdsp/patchpanel.c:209 [v2.10.3.13].
//                 AI-assisted transformation via Anthropic Claude Code.
```

### 2.2 Grouping and comment style

Two banner widths are in use, both live:

```cpp
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Frequency shift (shift.h)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

```cpp
// =====================================================================
// NR1 ,  Adaptive Noise Reduction (WDSP anr.c, Warren Pratt NR0V)
// From Thetis wdsp/anr.h:47-52 [v2.10.3.13]. Channel = WDSP channel id.
// =====================================================================
```

The `=====` form is used for newer, subsystem-scoped blocks and carries the
upstream header cite on the banner. Use that form for the notch block. Blank
line between declarations inside a `=====` group; no blank line inside a tight
`-----` group.

### 2.3 The existing RXANBP declarations, VERBATIM

`wdsp_api.h:328-341`:

```cpp
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bandpass filter (bandpass.h / bandpass.c)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

void SetRXABandpassFreqs(int channel, double f_low, double f_high);

// CRITICAL: SetRXABandpassFreqs only updates bp1, which only runs when
// AMD/SNBA/EMNR/ANF/ANR is enabled. For plain SSB the active filter is
// nbp0, controlled by RXANBPSetFreqs. Thetis always calls BOTH together
// (rxa.cs:110-111, radio.cs:603-604). Call both in setFilterFreqs.
void RXANBPSetFreqs(int channel, double flow, double fhigh);

void SetRXABandpassNC(int channel, int nc);
```

`wdsp_api.h:346-357`:

```cpp
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Frequency shift (shift.h)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

void SetRXAShiftRun(int channel, int run);

void SetRXAShiftFreq(int channel, double fshift);

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Notch bandpass shift (nbp.h) ,  From Thetis radio.cs:1418
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

void RXANBPSetShiftFrequency(int channel, double shift);
```

**No other RXANBP notch function is declared today.** `grep RXANBP src/`
returns only `wdsp_api.h`. The nine functions from spec §6.1 are all present
and `PORT`-exported in the vendored tree; I verified each line number in
`third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c`:

| Function | nbp.c line | Verified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RXANBPAddNotch` | 362 | yes |
| `RXANBPGetNotch` | 393 | yes |
| `RXANBPDeleteNotch` | 418 | yes |
| `RXANBPEditNotch` | 444 | yes |
| `RXANBPGetNumNotches` | 465 | yes |
| `RXANBPSetTuneFrequency` | 475 | yes |
| `RXANBPSetNotchesRun` | 499 | yes |
| `RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth` | 594 | yes |
| `RXANBPSetAutoIncrease` | 604 | yes |

**Trap worth stating**: `third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.h` declares only
`RXANBPSetFreqs` / `SetNC` / `SetMP` (lines 96 / 98 / 100). The notch entry
points exist in `nbp.c` with the `PORT` macro but are NOT in the vendored
header, which is exactly why `wdsp_api.h` has to declare them itself. That is
the pre-existing pattern (`RXANBPSetShiftFrequency` is in the same situation).

## 3. `RadioModel` (`src/models/RadioModel.h` 3277 lines / `.cpp` 13144 lines)

### 3.1 Sub-model ownership and exposure (the pattern `NotchModel` must copy)

Forward declaration at `RadioModel.h:182`: `class SpotModel;`

Accessor, `RadioModel.h:768`:

```cpp
    SpotModel*            spotModel()           const { return m_spotModel.get(); }
```

Member, `RadioModel.h:3066`:

```cpp
    std::unique_ptr<SpotModel>            m_spotModel;
```

Construction, `RadioModel.cpp:1595`:

```cpp
    m_spotModel           = std::make_unique<SpotModel>(this);
```

The sub-model itself (`SpotModel.h:76-80`):

```cpp
class SpotModel : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit SpotModel(QObject* parent = nullptr);
    ~SpotModel() override = default;
```

`NotchModel` gets the identical treatment: forward decl in `RadioModel.h`,
`std::unique_ptr<NotchModel> m_notchModel;` in the private members, a
`NotchModel* notchModel() const { return m_notchModel.get(); }` accessor in the
public accessor block, `std::make_unique<NotchModel>(this)` in the ctor.

**Build registration**: `CMakeLists.txt` lists model sources EXPLICITLY, no
glob. `src/models/NotchModel.cpp` must be added to `set(MODEL_SOURCES ...)`
at `CMakeLists.txt:656-673`.

### 3.2 Slice accessors

`RadioModel.h:374`:

```cpp
    QList<SliceModel*> slices() const { return m_slices; }
```

`RadioModel.h:383` (doc block at `:376-382` warns ids are NOT list positions):

```cpp
    SliceModel* sliceById(int sliceId) const;
```

Impl `RadioModel.cpp:3735-3743`:

```cpp
SliceModel* RadioModel::sliceById(int sliceId) const
{
    for (SliceModel* s : m_slices) {
        if (s && s->sliceIndex() == sliceId) {
            return s;
        }
    }
    return nullptr;
}
```

`RadioModel.h:412`, impl `RadioModel.cpp:2909-2916`:

```cpp
    int maxSlices() const;
```
```cpp
int RadioModel::maxSlices() const
{
    if (!isConnected()) {
        return 1;
    }
    const int n = boardCapabilities().maxSlices;
    return n > 0 ? n : 1;
}
```

Invariant to rely on: **WDSP RX channel id == `slice->sliceIndex()`**
(stated at `RadioModel.cpp:3110`, `WdspEngine.h:194-208`). Fan-out therefore
looks like:

```cpp
for (SliceModel* s : std::as_const(m_slices)) {
    if (RxChannel* ch = m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(s->sliceIndex())) { /* ... */ }
}
```

`std::as_const` on the loop is the house style in this file.

### 3.3 `bindSliceToStream` (declared `RadioModel.h:2417`, defined `RadioModel.cpp:3572`)

```cpp
    bool bindSliceToStream(SliceModel* slice, double frequencyHz);
```

Head (`RadioModel.cpp:3572-3605`):

```cpp
bool RadioModel::bindSliceToStream(SliceModel* slice, double frequencyHz)
{
    if (!slice) { return false; }
    if (m_streamAllocator.streamCount() <= 0) { return false; }

    const int previousStream = slice->streamIndex();
    const bool ddcPinned =
        m_receiverManager && m_receiverManager->ddcFrequencyLocked();
    const bool soleOccupant =
        previousStream >= 0 && slicesOnStream(previousStream).size() == 1;

    const auto placement =
        (previousStream < 0)
            ? m_streamAllocator.placeSlice(frequencyHz)
            : m_streamAllocator.retuneSlice(previousStream, soleOccupant,
                                            ddcPinned, frequencyHz);

    using Outcome = NereusSDR::SliceStreamAllocator::Outcome;
```

The DDC centre push for `NewStream` / `RetunedStream` (`RadioModel.cpp:3646-3657`):

```cpp
        if (m_receiverManager) {
            m_receiverManager->setReceiverFrequency(
                placement.streamIndex,
                static_cast<quint64>(placement.newStreamCentreHz));
        }
        emit streamCentreChanged(
            placement.streamIndex, placement.newStreamCentreHz,
            m_streamAllocator.streamSampleRateHz(placement.streamIndex));
```

**The insertion point named by spec §4.2** (`RadioModel.cpp:3663-3679`):

```cpp
    slice->setStreamIndex(placement.streamIndex);
    slice->setShiftOffsetHz(placement.shiftOffsetHz);
    // ...
    // Push the offset into WDSP. RxChannel::setShiftFrequency is the Thetis
    // RXOsc port (radio.cs:1409-1420 [v2.10.3.15]): SetRXAShiftFreq +
    // RXANBPSetShiftFrequency.
    if (m_wdspEngine) {
        if (RxChannel* ch = m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(slice->sliceIndex())) {
            ch->setShiftFrequency(placement.shiftOffsetHz);
        }
    }
```

Tail (`RadioModel.cpp:3705-3714`): `activateSliceChannel(slice);` then
`requestDdcAssignment(); return true;`.

### 3.4 `openRxChannelPool` (declared `RadioModel.h:447`, defined `RadioModel.cpp:3033`)

```cpp
    void openRxChannelPool(int poolSize, int inputBufferSize,
                           int inputSampleRateHz);
```

Body core (`RadioModel.cpp:3040-3068`):

```cpp
    const int requested = poolSize > 0 ? poolSize : 1;
    const int clamped = std::min(requested, WdspEngine::kMaxSliceChannels);
    if (clamped < requested) {
        qCWarning(lcDsp) << "RX channel pool request" << requested /* ... */;
    }

    for (int ch = WdspEngine::kFirstSliceChannelId; ch < clamped; ++ch) {
        if (!m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(ch)) {
            m_wdspEngine->createRxChannel(ch, inputBufferSize, 4096,
                                          inputSampleRateHz, 48000, 48000);
        }
    }
    // ...
    activateBoundSliceChannels();
}
```

### 3.5 `activateSliceChannel` (declared `RadioModel.h:466`, defined `RadioModel.cpp:3111`)

VERBATIM (`RadioModel.cpp:3111-3147`):

```cpp
void RadioModel::activateSliceChannel(SliceModel* slice)
{
    if (!m_wdspEngine || !slice || slice->streamIndex() < 0) {
        return;
    }

    // Sub-Epic I invariant: WDSP RX channel id == slice index.
    RxChannel* ch = m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(slice->sliceIndex());
    if (!ch || ch->isActive()) {
        // Already live. Leave it alone: connectToRadio's WDSP-init lambda
        // gives Slice A's channel the full state push (NR, SNB, APF, squelch,
        // audio panel, the lot) and then activates it, and re-running the
        // subset below on top of that would be a downgrade dressed as a
        // refresh.
        return;
    }

    ch->setMode(slice->dspMode());
    ch->setFilterFreqs(slice->filterLow(), slice->filterHigh());
    ch->setAgcMode(slice->agcMode());
    ch->setAgcTop(slice->rfGain());
    ch->setAfGain(slice->afGain() / 100.0);
    // The offset the allocator resolved for this slice. bindSliceToStream
    // pushes it too, but a reconnect re-opens the channel underneath an
    // already-bound slice, so it has to be re-seeded here as well.
    ch->setShiftFrequency(slice->shiftOffsetHz());

    ch->setActive(true);
}
```

Note the early return on `ch->isActive()` ,  spec §4.2 flags this as why
`activateSliceChannel` is dead as a notch hook, and §6.3 flags that
`connectToRadio` activates channel 0 at `RadioModel.cpp:5365` BEFORE
`openRxChannelPool` at `:5377`.

Siblings: `activateBoundSliceChannels()` (`.h:457` / `.cpp:3104`),
`deactivateSliceChannel(int sliceId)` (`.h:471` / `.cpp:3153`),
`bindUnboundSlices()` (`.h:478` / `.cpp:3163`).

### 3.6 `wireSliceSignals` (declared `RadioModel.h:2244`, defined `RadioModel.cpp:8218`)

```cpp
    void wireSliceSignals(SliceModel* slice);
```

Test seam already present (`RadioModel.h:1191`):

```cpp
    void wireSliceSignalsForTest() { wireSliceSignals(m_activeSlice); }
```

**Connect shape used throughout** (`RadioModel.cpp:8933-8946`):

```cpp
    connect(slice, &SliceModel::mutedChanged, this, [this, slice](bool v) {
        RxChannel* rxCh = m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(slice->sliceIndex());
        if (rxCh) {
            rxCh->setMuted(v);
        }
        scheduleSettingsSave();
    });
```

`scheduleSettingsSave()` is declared `RadioModel.h:2308` (private); the
500 ms-debounced coalescer. `flushPendingSettingsSave()` is the public
force-run used on quit paths.

**The connect-time seed, spec §4.5** (`RadioModel.cpp:9202-9215`):

```cpp
    // Send initial frequency to radio (after connection init completes).
    // XIT offset applied here too so on-connect TX NCO matches the stored
    // XIT state without needing a separate update trigger.
    QTimer::singleShot(100, this, [this, slice]() {
        if (m_connection && m_connection->isConnected()) {
            int rxIdx = slice->streamIndex();
            quint64 freqHz = static_cast<quint64>(slice->frequency());
            if (rxIdx >= 0) {
                m_receiverManager->setReceiverFrequency(rxIdx, freqHz);
            }
            // Seed the transmit frequency from the TX-bound slice, which on
            // connect is usually but not necessarily this one.
            pushTxFrequencyFromTxSlice();
        }
    });
```

`freqHz` is at `:9207`, `setReceiverFrequency` at `:9209`. Matches the spec.

### 3.7 The `updateShiftFrequency` lambda, VERBATIM (`RadioModel.cpp:8956-8988`)

```cpp
    // RIT + DIG offset → WDSP shift frequency
    //
    // RIT (Receive Incremental Tuning): client-side demodulation offset that
    // does NOT retune the hardware VFO.
    // From Thetis console.cs ,  RIT adjusts receive demodulation without moving
    // the hardware DDC center.
    //
    // DIG offset: per-mode click-tune demodulation offset for DIGL/DIGU.
    // From Thetis console.cs:14637 (DIGUClickTuneOffset) and :14672
    // (DIGLClickTuneOffset). Both are int offsets in Hz; Thetis uses per-mode
    // filter re-centering internally, but NereusSDR implements DIG offset as
    // an additive shift on the same setShiftFrequency path as RIT.
    //
    // Combined: shift = ritOffset + digOffset (where digOffset is mode-gated).
    // For 3G-10 (single RX, no CTUN), the shift = these two terms only.
    auto updateShiftFrequency = [this, slice]() {
        RxChannel* rxCh = m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(slice->sliceIndex());
        if (!rxCh) { return; }
        double offset = slice->ritEnabled()
                        ? static_cast<double>(slice->ritHz())
                        : 0.0;
        // DIG offset per mode ,  Thetis console.cs:14637,14672
        if (slice->dspMode() == DSPMode::DIGL) {
            offset += static_cast<double>(slice->diglOffsetHz());
        } else if (slice->dspMode() == DSPMode::DIGU) {
            offset += static_cast<double>(slice->diguOffsetHz());
        }
        rxCh->setShiftFrequency(offset);
    };
    connect(slice, &SliceModel::ritEnabledChanged,  this, updateShiftFrequency);
    connect(slice, &SliceModel::ritHzChanged,        this, updateShiftFrequency);
    connect(slice, &SliceModel::diglOffsetHzChanged, this, updateShiftFrequency);
    connect(slice, &SliceModel::diguOffsetHzChanged, this, updateShiftFrequency);
    connect(slice, &SliceModel::dspModeChanged,      this, updateShiftFrequency);
```

`rxCh->setShiftFrequency(offset);` is at `:8982`. This is the writer spec §4.4
says must compose `placement.shiftOffsetHz + rit + dig`, mirrored at
`:3676`. Note the lambda does NOT null-check `m_wdspEngine` (only `rxCh`);
`RadioModel::wdspEngine()` is constructed in the ctor so it is non-null for
the object's lifetime.

### 3.8 Signals / test seams needed by the TNF tests

`RadioModel.h:1947`:
```cpp
    void streamCentreChanged(int streamIndex, double centreHz, int sampleRateHz);
```

`RadioModel.h:2483-2485`:
```cpp
    double streamCentreHzForTest(int streamIndex) const {
        return m_streamAllocator.streamCentreHz(streamIndex);
    }
```

Other useful existing seams: `configureStreamPool(int userDdcCount, int maxSlices, int defaultRateHz)` (`.h:429`), `streamPoolSize()`, `activeStreamCount()`, `injectConnectionForTest(RadioConnection*)`, `wdspEngine()`, `addSlice()`.

---

## 4. `SliceStreamAllocator` (`src/core/SliceStreamAllocator.h` / `.cpp`)

### 4.1 `Placement` struct + `Outcome`, VERBATIM (`SliceStreamAllocator.h:37-51`)

```cpp
    enum class Outcome {
        JoinedExisting,   ///< Fits an active stream's window; set shift only.
        NewStream,        ///< Claimed a free DDC, centred on the slice.
        RetunedStream,    ///< Sole occupant; moved its stream's centre instead.
        Rejected          ///< No stream fits and none free. `reason` explains.
    };

    struct Placement {
        Outcome outcome{Outcome::Rejected};
        int     streamIndex{-1};
        double  shiftOffsetHz{0.0};     ///< slice freq minus stream centre
        double  newStreamCentreHz{0.0}; ///< set for NewStream / RetunedStream
        QString reason;                 ///< human-readable, for Rejected
    };
```

### 4.2 Public API (`SliceStreamAllocator.h:53-98`)

```cpp
    void configure(int userDdcCount, int maxSlices);
    void activateStream(int streamIndex, double centreHz, int sampleRateHz);
    void deactivateStream(int streamIndex);
    Placement placeSlice(double frequencyHz) const;
    Placement retuneSlice(int currentStream,
                          bool soleOccupant,
                          bool ddcPinned,
                          double frequencyHz) const;

    int  streamCount() const { return m_streams.size(); }
    int  activeStreamCount() const;
    bool isStreamActive(int streamIndex) const;
    double streamCentreHz(int streamIndex) const;
    int  streamSampleRateHz(int streamIndex) const;
    void setDefaultSampleRateHz(int rateHz) { m_defaultRateHz = rateHz; }
```

`streamCentreHz` impl (`SliceStreamAllocator.cpp:159-163`):

```cpp
double SliceStreamAllocator::streamCentreHz(int streamIndex) const
{
    if (streamIndex < 0 || streamIndex >= m_streams.size()) { return 0.0; }
    return m_streams.at(streamIndex).centreHz;
}
```

### 4.3 Outcome semantics ,  exactly what each branch sets

`placeSlice` (`SliceStreamAllocator.cpp:60-95`):

| Branch | outcome | streamIndex | shiftOffsetHz | newStreamCentreHz |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| window covers freq | `JoinedExisting` | matching stream | `frequencyHz - centreHz` | 0.0 (unset) |
| free DDC exists | `NewStream` | `firstFreeStream()` | **0.0** | `frequencyHz` |
| none | `Rejected` | -1 | 0.0 | 0.0 (`reason` set) |

`retuneSlice` (`SliceStreamAllocator.cpp:97-142`), in evaluation order:

1. `haveStream && soleOccupant && (!ddcPinned || !inWindow)` →
   `RetunedStream`, `streamIndex = currentStream`, **`shiftOffsetHz = 0.0`**,
   `newStreamCentreHz = frequencyHz`.
2. `inWindow` → `JoinedExisting`, `shiftOffsetHz = frequencyHz - centreHz`.
3. otherwise → falls through to `placeSlice(frequencyHz)`.

`windowContains` (`SliceStreamAllocator.cpp:36-48`), strict on both sides:

```cpp
bool SliceStreamAllocator::windowContains(const Stream& s,
                                          double frequencyHz) const
{
    if (!s.active || s.sampleRateHz <= 0) { return false; }
    const double halfWindow = static_cast<double>(s.sampleRateHz) / 2.0;
    const double offset     = frequencyHz - s.centreHz;
    // Strict both sides. From Thetis console.cs:31920 [v2.10.3.15]:
    //   if (rx2_osc > -sample_rate_rx1 / 2 && rx2_osc < sample_rate_rx1 / 2)
    // MW0LGE [2.7.0.9] only when RX'ing. Fixes issue where multirx would be
    // outside sample area after a tx  [original inline comment from
    // console.cs:31913]
    return offset > -halfWindow && offset < halfWindow;
}
```

**Consequence for spec §4.1/§4.2 that authors must internalise:** in the
dominant non-CTUN sole-occupant case the outcome is `RetunedStream` with
`shiftOffsetHz == 0.0`, which is exactly why `setShiftFrequency`'s
value-equality early return makes it a dead hook for the notch tune frequency.
The absolute quantity to push is the stream centre, reachable as
`m_streamAllocator.streamCentreHz(placement.streamIndex)` or, at bind time,
`placement.newStreamCentreHz` for New/Retuned outcomes.

---

## 5. `AppSettings` (`src/core/AppSettings.h`)

### 5.1 Exact API (`AppSettings.h:103-145`)

```cpp
class AppSettings {
public:
    static AppSettings& instance();
    explicit AppSettings(const QString& filePath);   // tests only
    ~AppSettings() = default;
    AppSettings(const AppSettings&) = delete;
    AppSettings& operator=(const AppSettings&) = delete;

    void load();
    void save();

    QVariant value(const QString& key, const QVariant& defaultValue = {}) const;
    void setValue(const QString& key, const QVariant& val);
    void remove(const QString& key);
    bool contains(const QString& key) const;
    QStringList allKeys() const;
    void clear();                       // test isolation; does NOT save()

    QVariant stationValue(const QString& key, const QVariant& defaultValue = {}) const;
    void setStationValue(const QString& key, const QVariant& val);
    QString stationName() const;
    void setStationName(const QString& name);
    QString filePath() const { return m_filePath; }
```

Never `QSettings`. Access is always `auto& s = AppSettings::instance();`.

### 5.2 True/False convention

Booleans persist as the literal strings `"True"` / `"False"`. The canonical
helper is file-local in `SliceModel.cpp:1594`:

```cpp
// Boolean → AppSettings canonical string.
QString boolStr(bool v) { return v ? QStringLiteral("True") : QStringLiteral("False"); }
```

Read side is a string compare, both forms in use in-tree:

```cpp
setAutoAgcEnabled(s.value(bp + QStringLiteral("AgcAutoEnabled")).toString() == QLatin1String("True"));
```
```cpp
bool on = s.value("MyFeatureEnabled", "False").toString() == "True";
```

### 5.3 Real per-model save/restore pair (`SliceModel.cpp`)

Key-prefix helpers, file-local anonymous namespace (`SliceModel.cpp:1560-1592`):

```cpp
namespace {

// Build the per-band prefix string, e.g. "Slice0/Band20m/".
QString bandPrefix(int sliceIndex, Band band)
{
    return QStringLiteral("Slice%1/Band%2/")
               .arg(sliceIndex)
               .arg(bandKeyName(band));
}

// Build the session-state prefix string, e.g. "Slice0/".
QString slicePrefix(int sliceIndex)
{
    return QStringLiteral("Slice%1/").arg(sliceIndex);
}
```

Save (`SliceModel.cpp:1612-1665`, excerpt):

```cpp
void SliceModel::saveToSettings(Band band)
{
    auto& s = AppSettings::instance();
    const QString bp = bandPrefix(m_sliceIndex, band);
    const QString sp = slicePrefix(m_sliceIndex);

    s.setValue(bp + QStringLiteral("Frequency"),    m_frequency);
    s.setValue(bp + QStringLiteral("AgcThreshold"), m_agcThreshold);
    // ...
    s.setValue(bp + QStringLiteral("DspMode"),      static_cast<int>(m_dspMode));
    s.setValue(bp + QStringLiteral("DiversityFineNullEnabled"),
               boolStr(m_diversityFineNullEnabled));

    // ── Session state (band-agnostic) ─────────────────────────────────────────
    s.setValue(sp + QStringLiteral("NrActive"),        static_cast<int>(m_activeNr));
    s.setValue(sp + QStringLiteral("Nr1Taps"),         m_nr1Taps);
    s.setValue(sp + QStringLiteral("Nr2AeFilter"),     boolStr(m_nr2AeFilter));
```

Restore (`SliceModel.cpp:1730-1760`, excerpt). **Every key is `contains`-guarded
so a missing key leaves the in-memory default untouched, and each restore goes
through the public setter so signals fire:**

```cpp
void SliceModel::restoreFromSettings(Band band)
{
    auto& s = AppSettings::instance();
    const QString bp = bandPrefix(m_sliceIndex, band);
    const QString sp = slicePrefix(m_sliceIndex);

    // ── Per-band DSP state ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // Each key: if absent, leave the current SliceModel default unchanged.

    if (s.contains(bp + QStringLiteral("Frequency"))) {
        setFrequency(s.value(bp + QStringLiteral("Frequency")).toDouble());
    }
    if (s.contains(bp + QStringLiteral("AgcThreshold"))) {
        setAgcThreshold(s.value(bp + QStringLiteral("AgcThreshold")).toInt());
    }
    if (s.contains(bp + QStringLiteral("AgcAutoEnabled"))) {
        setAutoAgcEnabled(s.value(bp + QStringLiteral("AgcAutoEnabled")).toString() == QLatin1String("True"));
    }
```

Declarations (`SliceModel.h:794-796`), plus the documented contract that
`saveToSettings` does NOT call `AppSettings::save()`:

```cpp
    void saveToSettings(NereusSDR::Band band);
    void restoreFromSettings(NereusSDR::Band band);
    static void migrateLegacyKeys();
```

Key names are PascalCase with `/`-delimited namespace segments. Spec §5.5 /
§9 name `NotchAutoIncrease` as one such key.

## 6. `SpectrumWidget` (`src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h` / `.cpp`)

### 6.1 Spot-overlay push API + ForTest convention, VERBATIM (`SpectrumWidget.h:1010-1122`)

The whole block is re-opened under a fresh `public:` for a MOC reason worth
copying if the notch API lands next to it:

```cpp
public:
    // ── Spot overlay (Phase 3J-2 Task E1) ─────────────────────────────────
    // Public structs + setters re-declared under a fresh `public:` access
    // specifier so MOC doesn't try to interpret the nested struct as a
    // slot declaration (the enclosing block above is `public slots:`).
    //
    // From AetherSDR src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h:283-294 [@0cd4559]
    struct SpotMarker {
        int    index{-1};
        QString callsign;
        double freqMhz{0.0};
        QString color;       // #AARRGGBB or empty for default

    bool   spotOverrideColorsForTest()  const { return m_spotOverrideColors; }
    QColor spotColorForTest()           const { return m_spotColor; }
```

**ForTest convention, stated:** suffix `ForTest`, public, `const` and
returning a `const&` for containers; a non-const `drawXForTest(QPainter&, QRect)`
forwarder exists so a test can drive the private draw routine and then inspect
the rebuilt hit rects without a real paint cycle. Mirror this exactly for
notches (`notchMarkersForTest()`, `notchHitRectsForTest()`,
`drawNotchMarkersForTest(...)`).

Push impl (`SpectrumWidget.cpp:5163-5171`) ,  note it does NOT call
`markOverlayDirty()`, only `update()`, and it short-circuits on a
visual-equality helper:

```cpp
void SpectrumWidget::setSpotMarkers(const QVector<SpotMarker>& markers)
{
    const bool visualChange = !spotMarkersVisuallyEqual(m_spotMarkers, markers);
    m_spotMarkers = markers;
    if (!visualChange) {
        return;
    }
    update();
}
```

Private draw declaration (`SpectrumWidget.h:1321`):

```cpp
    void drawSpotMarkers(QPainter& p, const QRect& specRect);
```

Called from two places, both gated on `if (m_showSpots)`:
- CPU `paintEvent` path, `SpectrumWidget.cpp:3043-3045`, between
  `drawWaterfall` and `drawVfoMarker`.
- GPU static-overlay rebuild, `SpectrumWidget.cpp:7143-7145`, same relative
  ordering. The in-tree comment there records the upstream ordering as
  "drawSpotMarkers between drawTnfMarkers and drawSliceMarkers"
  (AetherSDR `SpectrumWidget.cpp:3787 [@0cd4559]`), which is where notch
  markers belong: **before** `drawSpotMarkers`.

### 6.2 `markOverlayDirty` + overlay-cache members

`SpectrumWidget.h:2059-2068`:

```cpp
    // Invalidate the GPU-path cached overlay texture so grid, labels,
    // dBm scale, waterfall filter/zero-line/timestamp overlays, and
    // other QPainter-drawn chrome re-render on next frame. Safe no-op
    // when the GPU path is disabled.
    void markOverlayDirty() {
#ifdef LONGPATH_GPU_SPECTRUM
        m_overlayStaticDirty = true;
#endif
        update();
    }
```

It is the LAST member of the class, private, immediately before the closing
brace. Cache members, all inside `#ifdef LONGPATH_GPU_SPECTRUM`
(`SpectrumWidget.h:1984-2018`):

```cpp
    // ---- Overlay GPU resources ----
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline*       m_ovPipeline{nullptr};
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings* m_ovSrb{nullptr};
    QRhiBuffer*                 m_ovVbo{nullptr};
    QRhiTexture*                m_ovGpuTex{nullptr};
    QRhiSampler*                m_ovSampler{nullptr};
    QImage m_overlayStatic;
    bool   m_overlayStaticDirty{true};
    bool   m_overlayNeedsUpload{true};

    // 2026-05-26 KG4VCF dual-layer overlay split.
    // ... static = chrome that changes on operator interaction;
    //     dynamic = per-frame peak hold / blobs / noise floor ...
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings* m_ovDynSrb{nullptr};
    QRhiTexture*                m_ovDynGpuTex{nullptr};
    QImage m_overlayDynamic;
    bool   m_overlayDynamicDirty{true};
    bool   m_overlayDynamicNeedsUpload{true};
    qint64 m_overlayDynamicDirtyMs{0};
```

**Notch markers are chrome, not per-frame data: they go in the STATIC layer,
and every notch mutator must call `markOverlayDirty()`** (spots get away with
bare `update()` only because they refresh on their own cadence; a notch drag
must invalidate the cached texture or the marker will not move on the GPU path).

### 6.3 `mousePressEvent` structure (`SpectrumWidget.cpp:5887-6194`)

Order of checks, top to bottom. New notch hit tests must be inserted with full
awareness of this order (spec §7.3 governs which wins):

1. `:5890-5895` disconnected guard: swallow all left clicks, emit
   `disconnectedClickRequest()`, return.
2. `:5897-5903` geometry locals:
   ```cpp
    int w = width();
    int h = height();
    int specH = specHFromHeight(h, m_spectrumFrac, kFreqScaleH + kDividerH);
    int dividerY = specH;
    QRect specRect(0, 0, w - effectiveStripW(), specH);
    int mx = static_cast<int>(event->position().x());
    int my = static_cast<int>(event->position().y());
   ```
3. `:5906-5914` double-click on off-screen indicator → `recenterOnVfo()`.
4. `:5916-6014` `Qt::RightButton`: first the spot-label hit test (walk
   `m_spotClickRects`, build a `QMenu`, `menu.exec(event->globalPosition().toPoint())`,
   `event->accept(); return;`), then the fallback `SpectrumOverlayMenu`.
5. `:6013-6016` non-left buttons fall through to `QWidget::mousePressEvent`.
6. `:6021-6046` left-button spot label hit test, then cluster-badge hit test.
7. `:6048-6089` dBm scale strip (right edge) ,  arrow row, then drag-pan.
8. `:6092-6098` divider bar, `kDividerGrab = 6`.
9. `:6101-6121` frequency scale bar (LIVE button first, then bandwidth drag).
10. `:6123-6146` filter-edge grab, `kFilterGrab` tolerance:
    ```cpp
    double loHz = m_vfoHz + m_filterLowHz;
    double hiHz = m_vfoHz + m_filterHighHz;
    int xLo = hzToX(loHz, specRect);
    int xHi = hzToX(hiHz, specRect);
    if (xLo > xHi) { std::swap(xLo, xHi); }
    bool loHit = std::abs(mx - xLo) <= kFilterGrab;
    bool hiHit = std::abs(mx - xHi) <= kFilterGrab;
    ```
11. `:6148-6156` inside passband → `m_draggingVfo = true`.
12. `:6158-6183` time-scale strip / LIVE button.
13. `:6185-6194` fallback pan drag: `m_draggingPan = true; m_panDragStartX = mx;
    m_panDragStartCenter = m_centerHz; setCursor(Qt::ClosedHandCursor);` then
    `QWidget::mousePressEvent(event);`.

Every accepted branch either `return`s bare or does `event->accept(); return;`.
Drag state is a set of `m_draggingX` bools cleared en masse in
`mouseReleaseEvent` (`:6568-6574`):

```cpp
        m_draggingDbm = false;
        m_draggingFilter = FilterEdge::None;
        m_draggingVfo = false;
        m_draggingDivider = false;
        m_draggingPan = false;
        m_draggingBandwidth = false;
        setCursor(Qt::CrossCursor);
```

Click-vs-drag discrimination lives in `mouseReleaseEvent` (`:6518-6521`), a
**4 px Manhattan threshold on x** ported from AetherSDR `SpectrumWidget.cpp:1427-1457`:

```cpp
        if (m_draggingPan) {
            int dx = std::abs(static_cast<int>(event->position().x()) - m_panDragStartX);
            if (dx <= 4) {
                // ... xToHz + snap to m_stepHz, then emit frequencyClicked(hz)
```

`mouseMoveEvent` (`:6196-...`) opens with
`m_mousePos = event->pos(); m_mouseInWidget = true;`, recomputes the same
geometry locals, then dispatches on the drag flags in the same priority order,
each branch ending `return;`. `hzPerPx` inside a drag is computed as
`m_bandwidthHz / specRect.width()`.

### 6.4 Frequency <-> pixel helpers, VERBATIM

Declared private (`SpectrumWidget.h:1347-1351`):

```cpp
    // ---- Coordinate helpers ----
    int    hzToX(double hz, const QRect& r) const;
    double xToHz(int x, const QRect& r) const;
    int    dbmToY(float dbm, const QRect& r) const;
    float  dbmToYf(float dbm, const QRect& r) const; // sub-pixel variant for antialiased trace
```

Defined (`SpectrumWidget.cpp:4025-4036`):

```cpp
int SpectrumWidget::hzToX(double hz, const QRect& r) const
{
    double lowHz = m_centerHz - m_bandwidthHz / 2.0;
    double frac = (hz - lowHz) / m_bandwidthHz;
    return r.left() + static_cast<int>(frac * r.width());
}

double SpectrumWidget::xToHz(int x, const QRect& r) const
{
    double frac = static_cast<double>(x - r.left()) / r.width();
    return (m_centerHz - m_bandwidthHz / 2.0) + frac * m_bandwidthHz;
}
```

Both take the spectrum rect explicitly; callers build
`QRect specRect(0, 0, w - effectiveStripW(), specH)`. Neither is clamped, so a
hit test must range-check itself.

### 6.5 Signals available to a notch UI (`SpectrumWidget.h`)

```cpp
:1130    void spectrumFrameRendered();
:1134    void disconnectedClickRequest();
:1137    void frequencyClicked(double hz);
:1143    void spotTriggered(int spotIndex);
:1149    void spotRemoveRequested(int spotIndex);
:1155    void spotHoverIndexChanged(int spotIndex);
:1158    void filterEdgeDragged(int lowHz, int highHz);
:1160    void centerChanged(double centerHz);
:1162    void bandwidthChangeRequested(double newBandwidthHz);
:1169    void widebandExtensionStateChanged(bool extensionRequested);
:1177    void ddcRetuneRequested(double frequencyHz);
:1183    void dbmRangeChangeRequested(float minDbm, float maxDbm);
:1186    void ctunEnabledChanged(bool enabled);
```

New notch signals follow the same shape: plain values, Hz as `double`, index as
`int`.

## 7. Test conventions

### 7.1 A complete small test, VERBATIM (`tests/tst_slice_model_phase3f_properties.cpp`, first 51 lines + tail)

```cpp

private slots:
    // ── Task 4: sliceLetter ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    void slice_letter_default_is_A()
    {
        SliceModel slice;
        QCOMPARE(slice.sliceLetter(), QChar('A'));
    }

    void slice_letter_setter_round_trips()
    {
        SliceModel slice;
        slice.setSliceLetter(QChar('C'));
        QCOMPARE(slice.sliceLetter(), QChar('C'));
    }

    void slice_letter_setter_emits_signal()
    {
        SliceModel slice;

    }

    void slice_letter_setter_idempotent()
    {
        SliceModel slice;
        slice.setSliceLetter(QChar('B'));
        QSignalSpy spy(&slice, &SliceModel::sliceLetterChanged);
        slice.setSliceLetter(QChar('B'));  // same value
        QCOMPARE(spy.count(), 0);
    }
};

QTEST_MAIN(TestSliceModelPhase3FProperties)
#include "tst_slice_model_phase3f_properties.moc"
```

Hard requirements visible here:
- `// no-port-check:` marker on line 4 for NereusSDR-original tests (this is
  what keeps `scripts/check-new-ports.py` quiet).
- Header banner naming the file and the design-doc section.
- Includes are **repo-root-relative without `src/`**: `"models/SliceModel.h"`,
  `"core/RxChannel.h"`, `"gui/SpectrumWidget.h"`. This is also what drives the
  automatic ctest label derivation (`tests/CMakeLists.txt:65-89` matches
  `"(\\.\\./)*(src/)?core/"` etc.), so include paths are load-bearing.
- `using namespace NereusSDR;` after includes.
- Test class at **global scope** (required for the `friend class ::TestX;`
  seam), named `TestPascalCase`, `: public QObject`, `Q_OBJECT`,
  `private slots:`.
- Slot names are `snake_case_sentences`.
- `QTEST_MAIN(...)` then `#include "<file>.moc"`.
- Four-test shape per property: default / round-trip / emits / idempotent.

### 7.2 CMake registration (`tests/CMakeLists.txt`)

Registration is a single call preceded by a comment block that names the phase,
what is verified, and the source authority:

```cmake
# Phase 3F Sub-Epic A Tasks 4-6: SliceModel new Q_PROPERTYs
# Verifies three new Q_PROPERTYs added for multi-panadapter/multi-slice support:
#   Task 4: sliceLetter (QChar, default 'A') - per-slice letter ID for badge color
#   Task 5: chainIndex  (int,   default 0)   - which Alex chain (ADC) hosts slice DDC
#   Task 6: ddcIndex    (int,   default -1)  - codec-assigned DDC index; -1=unassigned
# Source: NereusSDR-original (no Thetis upstream).
# Design: docs/architecture/2026-05-26-phase3f-multi-pan-multi-slice-design.md §3.
longpath_add_test(tst_slice_model_phase3f_properties)
```

What `longpath_add_test(name)` does (`tests/CMakeLists.txt:114-203`):

```cmake
    add_executable(${name} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL ${name}.cpp $<TARGET_OBJECTS:longpath_test_sandbox> ${ARGN})
    target_link_libraries(${name} PRIVATE NereusSDRObjs Qt6::Test)
    set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY LONGPATH_ALL_TESTS ${name})
    if(LONGPATH_USE_PCH)
        target_precompile_headers(${name} REUSE_FROM NereusSDRObjs)
    endif()
    add_test(NAME ${name} COMMAND ${name})
    _longpath_derive_test_labels(_test_labels "${name}.cpp")
    set_tests_properties(${name} PROPERTIES
        LABELS "${_test_labels}"
        TIMEOUT 120)
```

Extra source files go as `ARGN`: `longpath_add_test(tst_foo Fake.cpp)`.
Per-test defines are added after the call, e.g.
`target_compile_definitions(tst_p1_wire_format PRIVATE LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS)`.
Tests are `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`; aggregates are `all_tests` and `tests_<label>`.

### 7.3 How a test gets a `RadioModel`

Plain stack construction, no fixture, no MainWindow
(`tests/tst_stream_pool_binding.cpp:70-88`):

```cpp
class TestStreamPoolBinding : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
private slots:
    void pool_sizes_to_the_sku()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        model.configureStreamPool(/*userDdcCount*/ 5, /*maxSlices*/ 5,
                                  /*defaultRateHz*/ 192000);
        QCOMPARE(model.streamPoolSize(), 5);
    }

    void first_slice_activates_stream_zero()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        model.configureStreamPool(5, 5, 192000);

        const int idx = model.addSlice();
        SliceModel* s = model.slices().at(idx);

        QCOMPARE(s->streamIndex(), 0);
        QCOMPARE(s->shiftOffsetHz(), 0.0);
    }
```

`RadioModel model;` on the stack; `configureStreamPool` then `addSlice()`. Note
`addSlice()` returns a slice **id**, and both `slices().at(id)` and
`sliceById(id)` appear in this file; prefer `sliceById` for new code.

**Caller-side value assertion seam** (spec §4.6 option 1) at
`tst_stream_pool_binding.cpp:576-584`:

```cpp
        // The invariant that actually matters: whatever the VFO reads, the
        // DSP must be demodulating it. Reconstruct the demodulated frequency
        // from the binding the way WDSP does -- stream centre plus shift --
        // and require it to equal the frequency on the flag.
        QCOMPARE(slice->streamIndex(), boundStream);
        const double demodulatedHz =
            model.streamCentreHzForTest(slice->streamIndex())
            + slice->shiftOffsetHz();
        QCOMPARE(slice->frequency(), demodulatedHz);
```

### 7.4 How a test gets a live `WdspEngine` (the friend seam)

Two edits are required, both in `src/core/WdspEngine.h`:

1. Global-scope forward declaration inside the existing
   `#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` block near the top (`WdspEngine.h:105-124`):

```cpp
// wrapper ,  friend declarations need the fully-qualified name.
class TestWdspEngineTxChannel;
// ...
// Phase 3F Sub-Epic I closeout, defect H1: the per-stream drain-geometry
// test primes the engine so createRxChannel can seed real RX channels.
class TestStreamPoolBinding;
// Phase 3F: the channel-id map test primes the engine so it can watch
// which ids openRxChannelPool actually opens.
class TestWdspChannelIdMap;
#endif
```

2. The friend line inside the class (`WdspEngine.h:674-694`):

```cpp
#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS
    // Test-only friend: lets unit tests bypass async wisdom load by setting
    // m_initialized = true directly so they can exercise createTxChannel /
    // createRxChannel without a running event loop or a real WDSP wisdom
    // file.  Production builds (without LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS) never see this.
    friend class ::TestWdspEngineTxChannel;
    friend class ::TstWdspEngineDexpInit;
    friend class ::TstPsFeedbackChannel;
    friend class ::TestSliceModelRadeSwap;
    friend class ::TestRadeApplet;
    friend class ::TestStreamPoolBinding;
    friend class ::TestWdspChannelIdMap;
#endif
};
```

Use at `tst_stream_pool_binding.cpp:997-1017`:

```cpp
    void single_slice_leaves_only_slice_as_channel_live()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        WdspEngine* engine = model.wdspEngine();
        engine->m_initialized = true;   // friend access (LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS)

        model.configureStreamPool(5, 5, 192000);
        const int a = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(a)->setFrequency(14200000.0);
        QVERIFY(model.sliceById(a)->streamIndex() >= 0);

        model.openRxChannelPool(5, bufferSizeForRate(192000), 192000);

        QVERIFY(engine->rxChannel(a) != nullptr);
        QVERIFY(engine->rxChannel(a)->isActive());
        for (int ch = 1; ch < 5; ++ch) {
            QVERIFY2(!engine->rxChannel(ch)->isActive(),
                     qPrintable(QStringLiteral("unbound pool channel %1 is running")
                                    .arg(ch)));
        }
    }
```

The standalone-engine variant (`tst_ps_feedback_channel.cpp:70-78`):

```cpp
    void hasUniqueChannelId() {
        WdspEngine engine;
        engine.m_initialized = true;   // friend access (LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS)
                                        // bypasses async wisdom path
        engine.openPsFeedbackChannelForTesting();
        TxChannel* tx = engine.createTxChannel(kTxChannelIdForTest);
```

Relevant `WdspEngine` API for a real opened channel (`WdspEngine.h:208-238`):

```cpp
    static constexpr int kMaxSliceChannels = 5;
    static constexpr int kFirstSliceChannelId = 0;
    static constexpr int kTxChannelId = kMaxSliceChannels;
    static constexpr int kPsFeedbackChannelId = kTxChannelId + 1;   // :426

    RxChannel* createRxChannel(int channelId,
                               int inputBufferSize = 238,
                               int dspBufferSize = 4096,
                               int inputSampleRate = 48000,
                               int dspSampleRate = 48000,
                               int outputSampleRate = 48000);
    void destroyRxChannel(int channelId);
    RxChannel* rxChannel(int channelId) const;
```

**Hazard restated from spec §4.6**: test binaries compile with live WDSP
(`HAVE_WDSP` is `PUBLIC` on `NereusSDRObjs`, `CMakeLists.txt:1124`), and
`rxa` is sized `MAX_CHANNELS = 32`, so the existing `kTestChannel = 99`
pattern used by the RxChannel tests is an out-of-bounds read for any WDSP call
that dereferences before comparing. `RXANBPSetTuneFrequency` dereferences at
`nbp.c:479` (`if (tunefreq != a->tunefreq)`), so the "pass the same value so
the C++ early return fires" hatch does not protect it. Use one of the two
seams above, not `kTestChannel = 99`.

## 8. Settings pages

### 8.1 The stub to fill in, VERBATIM (`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp:2103-2128`)

```cpp
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// MnfSetupPage
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// From Thetis setup.cs ,  tabDSP / tabPageMNF controls:
//   chkMNFAutoIncrease, comboMNFWindow, lstNotches (display)
//
MnfSetupPage::MnfSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent)
    : SetupPage("MNF", model, parent)
{
    // ── Manual Notch ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    QGroupBox* mnfGrp = addSection("Manual Notch");
    QVBoxLayout* mnfLay = qobject_cast<QVBoxLayout*>(mnfGrp->layout());

    auto* autoIncrease = new QPushButton("Enable");
    addLabeledToggle(mnfLay, "Auto-Increase", autoIncrease);

    auto* windowCombo = new QComboBox;
    windowCombo->addItems({"Blackman-Harris", "Hann", "Flat-Top"});
    addLabeledCombo(mnfLay, "Window", windowCombo);

    auto* notchList = new QLabel("(no notches)");
    addLabeledLabel(mnfLay, "Notch List", notchList);

    disableGroup(mnfGrp);
}
```

Header declaration (`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h:245-252`):

```cpp
// ── MNF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class MnfSetupPage : public SetupPage {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MnfSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr);
};
```

The NYI guard it must lose (`DspSetupPages.cpp:93-99`):

```cpp
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Helper: disable every child widget inside a group box (NYI guard).
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
static void disableGroup(QGroupBox* grp)
{
    grp->setEnabled(false);
}
```

### 8.2 Its `registerPage` call, VERBATIM (`src/gui/SetupDialog.cpp:609`)

```cpp
    registerPage(dsp, "MNF", [this] { return new MnfSetupPage(m_model); });
```

Context (`SetupDialog.cpp:586-621`): `QTreeWidgetItem* dsp = addCategory("DSP");`
then one `registerPage` per leaf, then `tick("DSP");`. The variant used when
the page has signals to wire up:

```cpp
    registerPage(dsp, "CFC", [this]() -> QWidget* {
        auto* cfcPage = new CfcSetupPage(m_model);
        connect(cfcPage, &CfcSetupPage::openCfcDialogRequested,
                this,    &SetupDialog::cfcDialogRequested);
        return cfcPage;
    });
```

`registerPage` itself (`SetupDialog.h:129-130`, `SetupDialog.cpp:307-315`) is
lazy: it records a factory, and `realizePage` builds it on first navigation.
**Do not do work in the page ctor that must run at app start.**

```cpp
QTreeWidgetItem* SetupDialog::registerPage(QTreeWidgetItem* parent,
                                          const QString& label,
                                          std::function<QWidget*()> factory)
{
    auto* item = new QTreeWidgetItem(parent, QStringList{label});
    item->setData(0, Qt::UserRole, static_cast<int>(m_pages.size()));
    m_pages.push_back(PageEntry{label, std::move(factory), nullptr, -1});
    return item;
}
```

### 8.3 `SetupPage` base API (`src/gui/SetupPage.h:26-93`)

```cpp
class SetupPage : public QWidget {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit SetupPage(const QString& title, RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr);
    explicit SetupPage(const QString& title, QWidget* parent = nullptr);
    virtual ~SetupPage() = default;

    QString pageTitle() const { return m_title; }
    virtual void syncFromModel();
    static void markNyi(QWidget* widget, const QString& phase);

    QGroupBox* addSection(const QString& title);

    QPushButton* addLabeledToggle(const QString& label);
    QComboBox*   addLabeledCombo(const QString& label, const QStringList& items);
    QSlider*     addLabeledSlider(const QString& label, int minimum, int maximum, int value);
    QSpinBox*    addLabeledSpinner(const QString& label, int minimum, int maximum, int value);
    QPushButton* addLabeledButton(const QString& label, const QString& buttonText);
    QLabel*      addLabeledLabel(const QString& label, const QString& value);
    QLineEdit*   addLabeledEdit(const QString& label, const QString& placeholder = {});

protected:
    QVBoxLayout* contentLayout() { return m_contentLayout; }
    RadioModel*  model()         { return m_model; }

    // ── Low-level helpers (for subclasses that build complex layouts) ─────────
    QHBoxLayout* addLabeledCombo(QLayout* parent, const QString& label, QComboBox* combo);
    QHBoxLayout* addLabeledSlider(QLayout* parent, const QString& label, QSlider* slider,
                                   QLabel* valueLabel = nullptr);
    QHBoxLayout* addLabeledToggle(QLayout* parent, const QString& label, QPushButton* toggle);
    QHBoxLayout* addLabeledSpinner(QLayout* parent, const QString& label, QSpinBox* spinner);
    QHBoxLayout* addLabeledEdit(QLayout* parent, const QString& label, QLineEdit* edit);
    QHBoxLayout* addLabeledLabel(QLayout* parent, const QString& label, QLabel* value);
};
```

A table (spec §9 requires one) has no helper: add it directly to
`qobject_cast<QVBoxLayout*>(grp->layout())` or to `contentLayout()`.

### 8.4 A fully-implemented page for the shape: `CfcSetupPage` (`DspSetupPages.cpp:1869-2101`)

Opening + null-model guard + a group with two-way model binding, VERBATIM
(`:1869-1960`):

```cpp
CfcSetupPage::CfcSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent)
    : SetupPage("CFC", model, parent)
{
    if (!model) {
        // No model ,  show disabled placeholder (consistent with AgcAlcSetupPage).
        QGroupBox* grp = addSection("Phase Rotator");
        disableGroup(grp);
        return;
    }

    TransmitModel& tx = model->transmitModel();

    // ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    // ── Group 1: Phase Rotator ────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    //
    // From Thetis setup.Designer.cs:46162-46280 [v2.10.3.13] ,  grpPhRot.
    // Four controls: chkPHROTEnable / udPhRotFreq / udPHROTStages /
    // chkPHROTReverse.  Tooltip strings copied verbatim from designer file.
    //
    QGroupBox* phRotGrp = addSection("Phase Rotator");
    QVBoxLayout* phRotLay = qobject_cast<QVBoxLayout*>(phRotGrp->layout());

    m_phRotEnableChk = new QCheckBox("Enable");
    m_phRotEnableChk->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("chkPHROTEnable"));
    m_phRotEnableChk->setChecked(tx.phaseRotatorEnabled());
    // From Thetis setup.Designer.cs:46281 [v2.10.3.13] ,  chkPHROTEnable tooltip.
    m_phRotEnableChk->setToolTip(QStringLiteral("Turn the phase rotator on or off"));
    phRotLay->addWidget(m_phRotEnableChk);

    m_phRotFreqSpin = new QSpinBox;
    m_phRotFreqSpin->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("udPhRotFreq"));
    m_phRotFreqSpin->setRange(TransmitModel::kPhaseRotatorFreqHzMin,
                              TransmitModel::kPhaseRotatorFreqHzMax);
    m_phRotFreqSpin->setSuffix(" Hz");
    m_phRotFreqSpin->setValue(tx.phaseRotatorFreqHz());
    // From Thetis setup.Designer.cs:46264 [v2.10.3.13] ,  udPhRotFreq tooltip.
    m_phRotFreqSpin->setToolTip(
        QStringLiteral("Set rotation frequency in Hz. (default 338)"));
    addLabeledSpinner(phRotLay, "FREQ", m_phRotFreqSpin);

    // ── Wiring: PhRot widgets ↔ TransmitModel ────────────────────────────────
    connect(m_phRotEnableChk, &QCheckBox::toggled,
            &tx, &TransmitModel::setPhaseRotatorEnabled);
    connect(&tx, &TransmitModel::phaseRotatorEnabledChanged,
            m_phRotEnableChk, [this](bool on) {
        QSignalBlocker b(m_phRotEnableChk);
        m_phRotEnableChk->setChecked(on);
    });

    connect(m_phRotFreqSpin, QOverload<int>::of(&QSpinBox::valueChanged),
            &tx, &TransmitModel::setPhaseRotatorFreqHz);
    connect(&tx, &TransmitModel::phaseRotatorFreqHzChanged,
            m_phRotFreqSpin, [this](int hz) {
        QSignalBlocker b(m_phRotFreqSpin);
        m_phRotFreqSpin->setValue(hz);
    });
```

The rules this encodes, all mandatory for the MNF page:
- `if (!model) { addSection(...); disableGroup(grp); return; }` guard first.
- Widgets are raw `new` with **Qt parent ownership via layout insertion** (the
  "no raw new" rule is satisfied by Qt ownership; this is the house exception
  and every page does it).
- `setObjectName(QStringLiteral("<thetisControlName>"))` on every control, using
  the literal Thetis designer name. For MNF that means `chkMNFAutoIncrease`,
  `chkMNFActive`, `udMNFFreq`, `udMNFWidth`, `udMNFNotch`, `chkVisualNotch`,
  `btnMNFAdd` / `Edit` / `Delete` / `Enter` / `Cancel`, per spec §9
  (`setup.designer.cs:44145-44159`).
- Ranges come from named `static constexpr` model constants
  (`TransmitModel::kPhaseRotatorFreqHzMin`), not literals.
- Initial value read from the model in the ctor.
- Tooltips verbatim from Thetis, with the cite in a `//` comment on the line
  ABOVE, never inside the user-visible string.
- Two-way binding is a pair of `connect`s; the model-to-widget direction always
  wraps in `QSignalBlocker b(m_widget);` to break the echo loop.
- `QOverload<int>::of(&QSpinBox::valueChanged)` for the spin box overload.
- Page-owned widget pointers are `m_camelCase{nullptr}` members declared in
  `DspSetupPages.h` grouped by group box with `// ── Group ──` comments.

File includes for `DspSetupPages.cpp` (`:64-87`) already cover
`core/AppSettings.h`, `core/wdsp_api.h`, `core/WdspEngine.h`,
`models/RadioModel.h`, `models/SliceModel.h`, `QCheckBox`, `QComboBox`,
`QSignalBlocker`, `QSpinBox`, `QTabWidget`, `QVBoxLayout`. A table adds
`QTableWidget` / `QTableView`.

### 8.5 The third stub to retire (`src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:272-278`)

```cpp
    // Button 9: MNF (NYI)
    {
        auto* btn = makeDisabledBtn("MNF", this);
        btn->setToolTip("Manual notch filter (NYI)");
        m_menuBtns.append(btn);  // index 7
    }
```

Spec §9 says replace this rather than shipping both, and that the overlay
button reads `+TNF`, not `+MNF`.

---

## 9. Build and test commands (`docs/development/fast-test-loop.md`)

Configure (from `CLAUDE.md`; tests are opt-in and OFF by default,
`CMakeLists.txt:1450`):

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DLONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS=ON
```

Build the app:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

Build and run ONE test (the everyday TDD loop):

```bash
cmake --build build --target tst_slice_auto_agc && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_slice_auto_agc$' --output-on-failure
```

Run one subsystem. **Always build the matching `tests_<label>` target first** , 
test executables are `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`, so a bare `ctest -L core` either
reports "Not Run" on a clean tree or silently runs stale binaries and returns a
false green:

```bash
cmake --build build --target tests_core && ctest --test-dir build -L core
```

Targets:

```bash
cmake --build build --target tst_slice_auto_agc   # one test
cmake --build build --target tests_core           # one subsystem
cmake --build build --target all_tests            # the lot (~32 min cold)
```

Labels are derived automatically from each test's own `#include` lines
(`core` / `models` / `gui` / `unclassified`); there is one `tests_<label>`
target per label. Every test carries `TIMEOUT 120`.

Suite facts: 513 registered tests, ~38 CPU-s to link each, ~32 min to build
all, ~5 min to run cold. Labels narrow the run, not the dependency: 85 tests
carry no `core` label but still statically link all of `NereusSDRObjs`.

macOS: exempt the terminal under **System Settings → Privacy & Security →
Developer Tools** or first-run malware scanning adds ~5 min to a cold suite.

ccache (auto-wired when on `PATH`) needs one non-default setting because of the
shared PCH:

```bash
ccache --set-config sloppiness=pch_defines,time_macros
```

Test writing: **never `QTest::qWait` for a state change**; use
`QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT(cond, ms)` plus a `QSignalSpy` count, and add a
narrow test-only seam rather than sleeping.

Settings sandbox: `tests/TestSandboxInit.cpp` runs a file-scope static ctor
before `main()` calling `QStandardPaths::setTestModeEnabled(true)`. The real
settings file is `~/Library/Preferences/NereusSDR/NereusSDR.settings` on macOS
and `~/.config/NereusSDR/NereusSDR.settings` on Linux.

---

## 10. Cross-cutting conventions

- Logging categories (`src/core/LogCategories.h:12-23`): `lcDiscovery`,
  `lcConnection`, `lcProtocol`, `lcReceiver`, `lcAudio`, `lcDsp`, `lcSpectrum`,
  `lcContainer`, `lcMeter`, `lcMmio`, `lcTci`, `lcSpots`. Notch work uses
  `lcDsp` (DSP/model side) and `lcSpectrum` (widget side). Log with
  `qCWarning(lcDsp) << ...`; never throw.
- Inline cite grammar in force this session:
  `// From Thetis <file>:<line> [v2.10.3.15]` and
  `// From AetherSDR <file>:<line> [@c6481cbf]`. Both bracket forms appear
  in-tree; older files carry `[v2.10.3.13]`, do not "fix" those.
- No source cites inside user-visible strings (tooltips, status bar, button
  captions). The cite goes in a `//` comment above the string.
- `no-port-check:` on line 3-4 of a NereusSDR-original file's banner is what
  keeps `scripts/check-new-ports.py` from flagging it
  (`SliceStreamAllocator.h:5`, every `tst_*.cpp`).
- New files with ported logic need the verbatim upstream header AND a
  `docs/attribution/THETIS-PROVENANCE.md` row in the same commit. Spec §10.1
  declares `src/models/NotchModel.{h,cpp}` a new attribution event over three
  upstream files.

---

## 11. Gaps / things the spec leaves for the plan author

Flagging these rather than inventing answers:

1. **`Notch` struct location and shape are not fully specified.** Spec §6.2
   uses `const QList<Notch>&` in `RxChannel::syncNotches` and §5.1 puts the
   data on `NotchModel`, but does not say whether `Notch` is nested in
   `NotchModel` or free in the `NereusSDR` namespace, nor its field names /
   types. The plan author must pick and state it; the house precedent
   (`RxChannel::Nr1Tuning`, `SpectrumWidget::SpotMarker`) is a nested public
   struct with brace-initialised defaults owned by the class that produces it,
   which would put `Notch` in `NotchModel` and have `RxChannel` include
   `models/NotchModel.h`. That is a `core` -> `models` include direction that
   `RxChannel.h` does not currently have (it includes only `core/` and
   `core/dsp/` headers), so it needs a deliberate decision.

2. **`SpectrumWidget` has no existing notch draw / hit-test member**, and spec
   §8.1/§8.2 describe the push API and rendering but I did not read those
   sections in full for this contract. Whatever they specify must land as
   `drawNotchMarkers(QPainter&, const QRect&)` private + a `ForTest` forwarder,
   inserted before `drawSpotMarkers` in BOTH the CPU path
   (`SpectrumWidget.cpp:3043`) and the GPU static-overlay rebuild
   (`SpectrumWidget.cpp:7143`). Missing the second call site is a silent
   GPU-only regression, since `LONGPATH_GPU_SPECTRUM` is the shipping path.

3. **`RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth` has no obvious refresh trigger in-tree.** It
   varies with `nc` and sample rate (spec §9). `RxChannel` already tracks
   `m_filterSize` / `m_dspBlockSize` and has `setFilterSizeSamples` /
   `setSampleRate`, but no signal fires on those today that a Settings page
   could subscribe to for a live readout. The plan author needs to either poll
   it on page show or add a `minNotchWidthChanged(double)` signal.

# Tasks

### Task 1: The gating fix: RXANBPSetTuneFrequency and three sibling defects

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp`
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt:1621` (register the new test after `longpath_add_test(tst_stream_pool_binding)`)
- Modify: `src/core/wdsp_api.h:130-136` (modification-history entry) and `src/core/wdsp_api.h:353-357` (new `extern "C"` declaration)
- Modify: `src/core/RxChannel.h:615-617` (accessors) and `src/core/RxChannel.h:936-938` (carry members)
- Modify: `src/core/RxChannel.cpp:1464-1489` (`setShiftFrequency` restructure + new `setNotchTuneFrequency`)
- Modify: `src/core/WdspEngine.h:121-124` (test-class forward decl) and `src/core/WdspEngine.h:691-694` (friend line)
- Modify: `src/models/RadioModel.h:2256-2258` (private helpers) and `src/models/RadioModel.h:2483-2485` (ForTest seam)
- Modify: `src/models/RadioModel.cpp:3140-3145` (`activateSliceChannel`), `:3671-3679` (`bindSliceToStream`), `:8955-8988` (`updateShiftFrequency` lambda), `:9201-9215` (connect-time seed), plus two new methods
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing. This is Task 1 of 11 and it is the premise of the rest.
- Produces:
  - `void RXANBPSetTuneFrequency(int channel, double tunefreq);` (`src/core/wdsp_api.h`, inside `extern "C"`, guarded by `HAVE_WDSP`)
  - `void RxChannel::setNotchTuneFrequency(double absoluteHz);`
  - `double RxChannel::notchTuneFrequencyHz() const;`
  - `double RxChannel::shiftOffsetHz() const;`
  - `double RxChannel::notchShiftHz() const;`
  - `double RadioModel::composedShiftHz(const SliceModel* slice) const;` (private)
  - `void RadioModel::seedConnectFrequency(SliceModel* slice);` (private)
  - `void RadioModel::seedConnectFrequencyForTest(SliceModel* slice);` (public test seam)
  - `friend class ::TestNotchTuneFrequency;` on `WdspEngine`

> **Plan comment on a spec divergence.** §4.4 says there are "**two** writers" of the shift
> (`RadioModel.cpp:3676` and `:8982`). There are **three**: `activateSliceChannel`
> (`RadioModel.cpp:3144`) pushes `slice->shiftOffsetHz()` too, and it runs at the **tail** of
> `bindSliceToStream` (`:3705`) on a first bind, i.e. immediately **after** the `:3676` push,
> so leaving it alone would discard the composed sum on every first bind. All three writers
> therefore go through `composedShiftHz`. Verified by reading `RadioModel.cpp:3111-3147`:
> the `if (!ch || ch->isActive()) { return; }` early return only makes it dead for an
> *already-live* channel, not for the first bind.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test (first three slots: the RxChannel carries, §4.6)**

Create `tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp`:

```cpp
// =================================================================
// tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp  (NereusSDR)
// =================================================================
// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original test infrastructure.
//
// Tunable Notch Filter, Task 1. Covers
// docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md §4 in full:
//   §4.1/§4.2  the notch database's tune frequency is the hosting DDC
//              stream's CENTRE, pushed from bindSliceToStream.
//   §4.3       the shift reaches the notch database on the way back down
//              to zero, and keeps its sign.
//   §4.4       the stream offset and RIT/DIG compose instead of clobbering
//              each other, asserted in both writer orders.
//   §4.5       the connect-time seed commands the stream centre, not the
//              slice frequency.
//
// The invariant every slot below is really asserting, from §4.1:
//     tunefreq + shift == the slice's demodulated RF
//                      == stream centre + slice offset + RIT + DIG
// asserted in BOTH halves, never the sum alone: a sum-only assertion
// passes under the double-count bug whenever the shift happens to be zero.
//
// WDSP is live in test binaries (CMakeLists.txt:1124 sets HAVE_WDSP PUBLIC)
// and RXANBPSetTuneFrequency dereferences rxa[channel].ndb.p before it

};

QTEST_MAIN(TestNotchTuneFrequency)
#include "tst_notch_tune_frequency.moc"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the test**

In `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, immediately after `longpath_add_test(tst_stream_pool_binding)` (line 1621):

```cmake
# ── Tunable Notch Filter Task 1: the notch DB's tune frequency ─────────────
# WDSP maps absolute-Hz notch centres into a channel's passband with
# offset = tunefreq + shift (third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:192). tunefreq had
# never been pushed by anything in this tree, so every channel's
# notchdb.tunefreq sat at its construction default and the whole notch
# feature was unimplementable on top of it. Pins all four halves of design
# doc §4: the pushed value is the hosting STREAM's centre and not the slice
# frequency (§4.1/§4.2, asserted for both the sole-owner and JoinedExisting
# outcomes); the shift reaches the notch database on the way back to zero
# and keeps its sign (§4.3); the stream offset and RIT/DIG compose instead
# of clobbering each other in either writer order (§4.4); and the
# connect-time DDC seed commands the stream centre (§4.5).
# Source: Thetis console.cs:31940-31941 + radio.cs:1419-1420 [v2.10.3.15].
# Design: docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md §4.
longpath_add_test(tst_notch_tune_frequency)
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Open the WdspEngine friend seam for the new test class**

In `src/core/WdspEngine.h`, append to the `#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` forward-declaration block (after `class TestWdspChannelIdMap;`, line 124):

```cpp
// TNF Task 1: the notch tune-frequency test primes the engine so
// createRxChannel opens real RX channels. RXANBPSetTuneFrequency
// dereferences rxa[channel].ndb.p before it compares (nbp.c:477-479), so
// the kTestChannel = 99 never-opened-channel hatch is unavailable here.
class TestNotchTuneFrequency;
```

and to the friend block inside the class (after `friend class ::TestWdspChannelIdMap;`, line 694):

```cpp
    // TNF Task 1: same friendship for the notch tune-frequency test, which
    // needs really opened RX channels rather than an unopened slot.
    friend class ::TestNotchTuneFrequency;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with
`error: no member named 'notchTuneFrequencyHz' in 'NereusSDR::RxChannel'`
(and the same for `setNotchTuneFrequency` and `shiftOffsetHz`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Declare `RXANBPSetTuneFrequency` in `wdsp_api.h`**

Append to the modification-history block, immediately before its
`// =================================================================`
terminator at `src/core/wdsp_api.h:136`:

```cpp
//   2026-07-29 ,  RXANBPSetTuneFrequency declaration added by J.J. Boyd
//                 (KG4VCF) during the Tunable Notch Filter epic, Task 1
//                 (docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-
//                 design.md §4). Nothing in this tree had ever called it,
//                 so every RXA channel's notchdb.tunefreq sat at its
//                 construction default and calc_nbp_lightweight mapped
//                 notch centres from the wrong RF origin
//                 (offset = b->tunefreq + b->shift, wdsp/nbp.c:192).
//                 Signature matches Thetis Console/dsp.cs:718-719
//                 [v2.10.3.15] P/Invoke decl and wdsp/nbp.c:475.
//                 AI-assisted transformation via Anthropic Claude Code.
```

Then insert the declaration inside the `extern "C"` block, after
`void RXANBPSetShiftFrequency(int channel, double shift);` at `:357`:

```cpp
// =====================================================================
// Notch bandpass tune frequency (nbp.c) ,  the RF origin the per-channel
// notch database maps its absolute-Hz notch centres from.
// calc_nbp_lightweight computes offset = tunefreq + shift
// (third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:192), so this is the hosting DDC stream's
// CENTRE, NOT the slice frequency: RXANBPSetShiftFrequency above already
// carries the slice's displacement from that centre.
// From Thetis console.cs:31940-31941 [v2.10.3.15] (RX1 pushes the same
// tunefreq to both subrx ids, RX1DDSFreq being CentreFrequency at
// console.cs:31932) and console.cs:32926 [v2.10.3.15] (RX2).
// Internally idempotent: nbp.c:479 guards on if (tunefreq != a->tunefreq).
// =====================================================================

void RXANBPSetTuneFrequency(int channel, double tunefreq);
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the `RxChannel` accessors and carries**

In `src/core/RxChannel.h`, replace the block at `:615-617`:

```cpp
    // --- Frequency shift (for pan offset from VFO) ---

    void setShiftFrequency(double offsetHz);

    // The offset last handed to setShiftFrequency, in Hz. Carried because
    // WDSP exposes no getter for shift.freq, and the design-doc §4.1
    // invariant (notch tune frequency + shift == the slice's demodulated
    // RF) has to be assertable from the caller side.
    double shiftOffsetHz() const { return m_shiftOffsetHz; }

    // --- Notch bandpass tune frequency (TNF §4) ---

    // The RF origin the per-channel notch database maps its absolute-Hz
    // notch centres from: the hosting DDC stream's CENTRE, not the slice
    // frequency. WDSP sums it with the shift above
    // (offset = tunefreq + shift, third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:192) and
    // setShiftFrequency already carries the slice's displacement from that
    // centre, so driving this from the slice frequency would compute
    // 2*sliceFreq - streamCentre.
    // From Thetis console.cs:31940-31941 [v2.10.3.15].
    void setNotchTuneFrequency(double absoluteHz);
    double notchTuneFrequencyHz() const { return m_notchTuneFrequencyHz; }
```

and replace the carry member at `:936-938`:

```cpp
    // Shift offset carry (mirrors what was last passed to setShiftFrequency)
    double m_shiftOffsetHz{0.0};

    // Notch tune-frequency carry (mirrors what was last passed to
    // RXANBPSetTuneFrequency). Plain member, not atomic: WDSP owns the
    // authoritative notch database and the audio thread never reads this,
    // so it is main-thread-only state.
    double m_notchTuneFrequencyHz{0.0};
```

In `src/core/RxChannel.cpp`, append after `setShiftFrequency` (currently ends
at `:1489`):

```cpp
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Notch bandpass tune frequency (TNF §4)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

void RxChannel::setNotchTuneFrequency(double absoluteHz)
{
    // Carry set outside the WDSP guard, mirroring setShiftFrequency, so a
    // stub build and the unit tests still see the quantity the caller
    // resolved.
    m_notchTuneFrequencyHz = absoluteHz;

#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis console.cs:31940-31941 [v2.10.3.15] ,  pushed on every
    // retune, unconditionally, and the SAME value goes to every subrx
    // sharing the stream. RXANBPSetTuneFrequency is internally idempotent
    // (nbp.c:479, if (tunefreq != a->tunefreq)), so an unconditional push
    // costs nothing.
    RXANBPSetTuneFrequency(m_channelId, absoluteHz);
#endif
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (3 slots).

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp tests/CMakeLists.txt src/core/WdspEngine.h src/core/wdsp_api.h src/core/RxChannel.h src/core/RxChannel.cpp
git commit -m "feat(dsp): declare RXANBPSetTuneFrequency and carry it on RxChannel"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 9: Write the failing test for §4.3 (the shift must reach the notch DB on the way back to zero)**

Add to `tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp`, after `shift_push_keeps_its_sign()`:

```cpp
    void shift_reaches_the_notch_database_on_the_way_back_to_zero()
    {
        WdspEngine engine;
        engine.m_initialized = true;
        RxChannel* ch = engine.createRxChannel(0, bufferSizeForRate(kRateHz),
                                               4096, kRateHz, 48000, 48000);
        QVERIFY(ch != nullptr);

        ch->setShiftFrequency(10000.0);
        QCOMPARE(ch->notchShiftHz(), 10000.0);

        // §4.3. RXANBPSetShiftFrequency is the sole writer of
        // NOTCHDB->shift (third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:487-496) and
        // calc_nbp_lightweight consumes that field with no reference to any
        // run flag (nbp.c:192), so the old near-zero branch -- which called
        // SetRXAShiftRun(channel, 0) and nothing else -- left the notch
        // database holding a stale shift on every RIT-off, DIG-exit, band
        // jump and CTUN-off. Thetis has no such branch: radio.cs:1419-1420
        // [v2.10.3.15] pushes both setters on every RXOsc change including a
        // change to zero, and SetRXAShiftRun appears nowhere in its Console
        // tree. notchShiftHz() is written next to the WDSP call it mirrors,
        // so it goes stale here if the gate ever comes back.
        ch->setShiftFrequency(0.0);
        QCOMPARE(ch->shiftOffsetHz(), 0.0);
        QCOMPARE(ch->notchShiftHz(), 0.0);
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with
`error: no member named 'notchShiftHz' in 'NereusSDR::RxChannel'`.

- [ ] **Step 11: Restructure `setShiftFrequency` so only the run flag stays gated**

In `src/core/RxChannel.h`, add the accessor immediately after
`double notchTuneFrequencyHz() const { ... }`:

```cpp
    // The shift value last handed to RXANBPSetShiftFrequency. Deliberately
    // distinct from shiftOffsetHz(): it is written next to that call, so it
    // is what tells a caller (and the test suite) whether the push actually
    // happened. NOTCHDB->shift is write-only from the host side
    // (third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:487-496 is its sole writer) and
    // calc_nbp_lightweight reads it with no reference to any run flag
    // (nbp.c:192), so a shift that stops being pushed fails silently.
    double notchShiftHz() const { return m_notchShiftHz; }
```

and the carry member immediately after `m_notchTuneFrequencyHz`:

```cpp
    // Notch shift carry (mirrors what was last passed to
    // RXANBPSetShiftFrequency). Main-thread-only, same reasoning as
    // m_notchTuneFrequencyHz. Do NOT move this write away from the WDSP
    // call it mirrors in setShiftFrequency; that co-location is the point.
    double m_notchShiftHz{0.0};
```

In `src/core/RxChannel.cpp`, replace `setShiftFrequency` (`:1468-1489`) in full:

```cpp
void RxChannel::setShiftFrequency(double offsetHz)
{
    if (offsetHz == m_shiftOffsetHz) {
        return;
    }

    m_shiftOffsetHz = offsetHz;

#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis radio.cs:1419-1420 [v2.10.3.15] ,  both calls use the same
    // sign, and both fire on EVERY RXOsc change, including a change back to
    // zero. Thetis has no run gate at all: SetRXAShiftRun appears nowhere in
    // its Console tree, so the gate below is NereusSDR-original and now
    // covers only the run flag.
    //
    // The two frequency pushes used to sit inside the else of an
    // if (std::abs(offsetHz) < 0.5) branch, so returning to zero skipped
    // them. SetRXAShiftRun writes rxa[channel].shift.p->run (shift.c:113-116)
    // and never touches NOTCHDB->shift, RXANBPSetShiftFrequency is that
    // field's sole writer (nbp.c:487-496), and calc_nbp_lightweight consumes
    // it unconditionally (nbp.c:192). The stored shift therefore went stale
    // on every RIT-off, DIGU/DIGL exit, band jump and CTUN-off, and every
    // notch would have been mapped off its carrier.
    //
    // No sign change. Thetis's -value is not a divergence: rx_osc is already
    // the negated quantity upstream (console.cs:31916-31922,
    // rx2_osc = RXOsc - diff), so Thetis's -rx_osc equals the offsetHz handed
    // in here, which equals frequencyHz - centreHz at
    // SliceStreamAllocator.cpp:70.
    SetRXAShiftFreq(m_channelId, offsetHz);
    RXANBPSetShiftFrequency(m_channelId, offsetHz);
    // Written here, next to the call it mirrors, and not up beside
    // m_shiftOffsetHz: notchShiftHz() exists to say whether the push above
    // really happened.
    m_notchShiftHz = offsetHz;
    SetRXAShiftRun(m_channelId, std::abs(offsetHz) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1);
#else
    m_notchShiftHz = offsetHz;
#endif
}
```

- [ ] **Step 12: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (4 slots).

```bash

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (8 slots).

- [ ] **Step 18: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp src/models/RadioModel.cpp
git commit -m "fix(dsp): push the hosting stream centre as the notch tune frequency"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 19: Write the failing tests for §4.4 (the two writers must compose, not clobber)**

Add to `tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp`, after the §4.1/§4.2 slots:

```cpp
    // ── §4.4: the stream offset and RIT/DIG compose ──────────────────────
    //
    // Both writer orders, because fixing only one leaves the mirror bug:
    // RadioModel.cpp:3676 pushed the placement offset with no RIT term and
    // the wireSliceSignals lambda pushed RIT with no placement term, so
    // whichever fired last won and threw the other away.
    //
    // wireSliceSignals early-returns on !m_connection (RadioModel.cpp:8228),
    // so the RIT lambda only exists once a connection is injected. It is
    // never opened: isConnected() stays false, which also keeps the
    // connect-time seed's singleShot a no-op.

    void rit_adds_to_the_stream_shift_instead_of_replacing_it()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        P1RadioConnection conn;
        model.injectConnectionForTest(&conn);
        DetachConnection detach{&model};

        WdspEngine* engine = model.wdspEngine();
        engine->m_initialized = true;

        model.configureStreamPool(2, 2, kRateHz);
        model.openRxChannelPool(2, bufferSizeForRate(kRateHz), kRateHz);

        const int a = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(a)->setFrequency(kSliceAFreqHz);

        const int b = model.addSlice();
        SliceModel* sliceB = model.sliceById(b);
        sliceB->setFrequency(kSliceBFreqHz);

        RxChannel* chB = engine->rxChannel(b);
        QVERIFY(chB != nullptr);
        QCOMPARE(chB->shiftOffsetHz(), 10000.0);

        sliceB->setRitHz(500);
        sliceB->setRitEnabled(true);

        // 10 kHz of stream offset PLUS 500 Hz of RIT, not 500 Hz alone.
        QCOMPARE(chB->shiftOffsetHz(), 10500.0);
        QCOMPARE(chB->notchTuneFrequencyHz(), kSliceAFreqHz);
        QCOMPARE(chB->notchTuneFrequencyHz() + chB->shiftOffsetHz(),
                 sliceB->effectiveRxFrequency());
    }

    void a_retune_while_rit_is_on_keeps_the_rit_term()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        P1RadioConnection conn;
        model.injectConnectionForTest(&conn);
        DetachConnection detach{&model};

        WdspEngine* engine = model.wdspEngine();
        engine->m_initialized = true;

        model.configureStreamPool(2, 2, kRateHz);
        model.openRxChannelPool(2, bufferSizeForRate(kRateHz), kRateHz);

        const int a = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(a)->setFrequency(kSliceAFreqHz);

        const int b = model.addSlice();
        SliceModel* sliceB = model.sliceById(b);
        sliceB->setFrequency(kSliceBFreqHz);
        sliceB->setRitHz(500);
        sliceB->setRitEnabled(true);

        RxChannel* chB = engine->rxChannel(b);
        QVERIFY(chB != nullptr);
        QCOMPARE(chB->shiftOffsetHz(), 10500.0);

        // The mirror case: the retune writer must not drop the RIT term.
        sliceB->setFrequency(14205000.0);

        QCOMPARE(sliceB->shiftOffsetHz(), 5000.0);
        QCOMPARE(chB->shiftOffsetHz(), 5500.0);
        QCOMPARE(chB->notchTuneFrequencyHz(), kSliceAFreqHz);
        QCOMPARE(chB->notchTuneFrequencyHz() + chB->shiftOffsetHz(),
                 sliceB->effectiveRxFrequency());
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 20: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at runtime in `rit_adds_to_the_stream_shift_instead_of_replacing_it` with
`Compared values are not the same
   Actual   (chB->shiftOffsetHz()): 500
   Expected (10500.0)              : 10500`

- [ ] **Step 21: Compose the shift once and push the same sum from all three writers**

In `src/models/RadioModel.h`, add the private declaration immediately before
`void pushTxFrequencyFromTxSlice();` (line 2258):

```cpp
    // The total WDSP shift for a slice: the allocator's offset from its
    // hosting stream's centre, plus RIT, plus the per-mode DIG click-tune
    // offset. Three sites push the shift -- bindSliceToStream,
    // activateSliceChannel and the RIT/DIG lambda in wireSliceSignals -- and
    // they used to disagree about which terms belonged in it, so each
    // clobbered the others'. Toggling RIT on a shifted slice threw away the
    // stream offset; retuning with RIT on threw away the RIT.
    // See docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md §4.4.
    double composedShiftHz(const SliceModel* slice) const;
```

In `src/models/RadioModel.cpp`, add the definition immediately above
`void RadioModel::pushTxFrequencyFromTxSlice()` (line 8199):

```cpp
double RadioModel::composedShiftHz(const SliceModel* slice) const
{
    if (!slice) {
        return 0.0;
    }

    // The stream term: "slice freq minus stream centre"
    // (SliceStreamAllocator.h:48), committed to the slice by
    // bindSliceToStream before any of the three writers run.
    double offset = slice->shiftOffsetHz();

    // RIT (Receive Incremental Tuning): client-side demodulation offset that
    // does NOT retune the hardware VFO.
    // From Thetis console.cs ,  RIT adjusts receive demodulation without
    // moving the hardware DDC center.
    if (slice->ritEnabled()) {
        offset += static_cast<double>(slice->ritHz());
    }

    // DIG offset per mode ,  Thetis console.cs:14637 (DIGUClickTuneOffset)
    // and :14672 (DIGLClickTuneOffset).
    if (slice->dspMode() == DSPMode::DIGL) {
        offset += static_cast<double>(slice->diglOffsetHz());
    } else if (slice->dspMode() == DSPMode::DIGU) {
        offset += static_cast<double>(slice->diguOffsetHz());
    }

    return offset;
}
```

Writer 1, `bindSliceToStream` (the `ch->setShiftFrequency(...)` line added in
Step 16):

```cpp
            ch->setShiftFrequency(composedShiftHz(slice));
```

Writer 2, `activateSliceChannel` (`src/models/RadioModel.cpp:3140-3144`):

```cpp
    // The offset the allocator resolved for this slice, plus RIT and DIG.
    // bindSliceToStream pushes it too, but a reconnect re-opens the channel
    // underneath an already-bound slice, so it has to be re-seeded here as
    // well. Composed, not bare: this call runs at the TAIL of
    // bindSliceToStream on a first bind, so a plain slice->shiftOffsetHz()
    // here would silently discard the RIT term that call had just pushed.
    ch->setShiftFrequency(composedShiftHz(slice));
```

Writer 3, the `updateShiftFrequency` lambda in `wireSliceSignals`
(`src/models/RadioModel.cpp:8955-8983`), replacing the comment block and the
lambda body:

```cpp
    // RIT + DIG offset → WDSP shift frequency
    //
    // RIT (Receive Incremental Tuning): client-side demodulation offset that
    // does NOT retune the hardware VFO.
    // From Thetis console.cs ,  RIT adjusts receive demodulation without moving
    // the hardware DDC center.
    //
    // DIG offset: per-mode click-tune demodulation offset for DIGL/DIGU.
    // From Thetis console.cs:14637 (DIGUClickTuneOffset) and :14672
    // (DIGLClickTuneOffset). Both are int offsets in Hz; Thetis uses per-mode
    // filter re-centering internally, but NereusSDR implements DIG offset as
    // an additive shift on the same setShiftFrequency path as RIT.
    //
    // Post-3F these are NOT the only two terms. The slice also sits at an
    // offset from its hosting stream's centre, and this lambda used to push
    // RIT + DIG alone, so toggling RIT on a shifted slice clobbered the
    // stream offset and moved the demodulator off frequency. composedShiftHz
    // is the single sum every writer pushes (design doc §4.4).
    auto updateShiftFrequency = [this, slice]() {
        RxChannel* rxCh = m_wdspEngine->rxChannel(slice->sliceIndex());
        if (!rxCh) { return; }
        rxCh->setShiftFrequency(composedShiftHz(slice));
    };
```

- [ ] **Step 22: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (10 slots).

- [ ] **Step 23: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp src/models/RadioModel.h src/models/RadioModel.cpp
git commit -m "fix(dsp): compose the stream offset with RIT and DIG on every shift writer"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 24: Write the failing test for §4.5 (the connect-time seed)**

Add to `tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp`, after the §4.4 slots:

```cpp
    // ── §4.5: the connect-time DDC seed ──────────────────────────────────

    void the_connect_seed_commands_the_stream_centre_not_the_slice_frequency()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        WdspEngine* engine = model.wdspEngine();
        engine->m_initialized = true;

        model.configureStreamPool(2, 2, kRateHz);
        model.openRxChannelPool(2, bufferSizeForRate(kRateHz), kRateHz);

        const int a = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(a)->setFrequency(kSliceAFreqHz);

        const int b = model.addSlice();
        SliceModel* sliceB = model.sliceById(b);
        sliceB->setFrequency(kSliceBFreqHz);
        QCOMPARE(sliceB->streamIndex(), 0);

        // ReceiverManager drops a frequency for a receiver it never created
        // (ReceiverManager.cpp:226-228), so give stream 0 one.
        ReceiverManager* rm = model.receiverManager();
        QVERIFY(rm != nullptr);
        QCOMPARE(rm->createReceiver(), 0);

        QSignalSpy spy(rm, &ReceiverManager::receiverFrequencyChanged);
        model.seedConnectFrequencyForTest(sliceB);

        // The seed used to hand ReceiverManager slice->frequency()
        // (RadioModel.cpp:9206-9209). For a slice on the JoinedExisting path
        // that is the stream centre plus its own offset, so the DDC came up
        // 10 kHz off and every notch mapped off it came up wrong with it.
        // The allocator is authoritative, matching the bind-time push at
        // RadioModel.cpp:3649-3651.
        QCOMPARE(spy.count(), 1);
        QCOMPARE(spy.first().at(0).toInt(), 0);
        QCOMPARE(spy.first().at(1).toULongLong(),
                 static_cast<quint64>(kSliceAFreqHz));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 25: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with
`error: no member named 'seedConnectFrequencyForTest' in 'NereusSDR::RadioModel'`.
(A verbatim extraction of the current lambda body would then still fail at
runtime with `Actual: 14210000, Expected: 14200000`.)

- [ ] **Step 26: Seed the stream centre, not the slice frequency**

In `src/models/RadioModel.h`, add the private declaration immediately after
`double composedShiftHz(const SliceModel* slice) const;`:

```cpp
    // The connect-time DDC seed, factored out of the wireSliceSignals
    // singleShot so it can be driven without a live connection. Commands the
    // centre of whichever stream hosts `slice`, then re-seeds the TX NCO.
    // See design doc §4.5.
    void seedConnectFrequency(SliceModel* slice);
```

and the test seam immediately after `streamCentreHzForTest` (line 2485,
still inside the public block that precedes `private:`):

```cpp
    /// TNF Task 1 test seam (§4.5): runs the connect-time DDC seed without a
    /// live connection, so a test can assert the quantity it commands.
    void seedConnectFrequencyForTest(SliceModel* slice) {
        seedConnectFrequency(slice);
    }
```

In `src/models/RadioModel.cpp`, add the definition immediately above
`double RadioModel::composedShiftHz(...)`:

```cpp
void RadioModel::seedConnectFrequency(SliceModel* slice)
{
    if (!slice) {
        return;
    }

    // The hosting STREAM's centre, not slice->frequency(). A slice that
    // joined an existing stream sits at a non-zero offset inside its window
    // (SliceStreamAllocator.h:48) and the two quantities differ, so seeding
    // from the slice frequency dragged the DDC off by the stream delta. Same
    // wrong-quantity mistake the notch tune frequency corrects, and the same
    // fix: the allocator owns the centre, exactly as at
    // RadioModel.cpp:3649-3651.
    const int streamIndex = slice->streamIndex();
    if (streamIndex >= 0 && m_receiverManager) {
        const double centreHz = m_streamAllocator.streamCentreHz(streamIndex);
        m_receiverManager->setReceiverFrequency(
            streamIndex, static_cast<quint64>(centreHz));
    }

    // Seed the transmit frequency from the TX-bound slice, which on
    // connect is usually but not necessarily this one.
    pushTxFrequencyFromTxSlice();
}
```

and replace the seed lambda at `src/models/RadioModel.cpp:9201-9215`:

```cpp
    // Send initial frequency to radio (after connection init completes).
    // XIT offset applied here too so on-connect TX NCO matches the stored
    // XIT state without needing a separate update trigger.
    QTimer::singleShot(100, this, [this, slice]() {
        if (m_connection && m_connection->isConnected()) {
            seedConnectFrequency(slice);
        }
    });
```

- [ ] **Step 27: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tune_frequency && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tune_frequency$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (11 slots).

- [ ] **Step 28: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_notch_tune_frequency.cpp src/models/RadioModel.h src/models/RadioModel.cpp
git commit -m "fix(dsp): seed the connect-time DDC from the stream centre"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 29: Re-run the two neighbouring suites that share this code path**

`bindSliceToStream`, `activateSliceChannel` and `openRxChannelPool` are all
touched, and `tst_stream_pool_binding` asserts the sibling shift push at
`:576-584`.

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_stream_pool_binding tst_wdsp_channel_id_map tst_slice_stream_allocator && ctest --test-dir build -R '^(tst_stream_pool_binding|tst_wdsp_channel_id_map|tst_slice_stream_allocator)$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (3 tests, 0 failures). No commit; this is a regression gate on
the four commits above.

### Task 2: wdsp_api.h declarations and RxChannel notch wrappers

**Files:**
- Create: `src/core/dsp/Notch.h`
- Create: `tests/tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.cpp`
- Modify: `docs/attribution/THETIS-PROVENANCE.md:413` (append one row to the column-2 "Independently implemented" table, after the `src/core/dsp/TxChannelState.h` row)
- Modify: `src/core/wdsp_api.h:130-136` (append one modification-history entry before the closing `// ====` at :136)
- Modify: `src/core/wdsp_api.h:357` (insert the notch declaration block after Task 1's `RXANBPSetTuneFrequency` declaration, which Task 1 places directly under `void RXANBPSetShiftFrequency(int channel, double shift);`)
- Modify: `src/core/RxChannel.h:200-201` (add `#include "dsp/Notch.h"`), `:211` (add `#include <QList>`), `:617` region (public notch API, after Task 1's `setNotchTuneFrequency` / `notchTuneFrequencyHz` declarations), `:936-938` region (private carries, next to `m_shiftOffsetHz`)
- Modify: `src/core/RxChannel.cpp:1488` region (new notch section after Task 1's `RxChannel::setNotchTuneFrequency` definition, before the `// Channel state` banner at :1490)
- Modify: `src/core/WdspEngine.h:123` (test-only forward declaration) and `:694` (friend declaration)
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt:5732` (append `longpath_add_test` after `tst_diversity_dialog_persistence`)
- Test: `tests/tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.cpp`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes (from Task 1):
  - `void RXANBPSetTuneFrequency(int channel, double tunefreq);` declared in `src/core/wdsp_api.h` inside the `extern "C"` block
  - `void RxChannel::setNotchTuneFrequency(double absoluteHz);`
  - `double RxChannel::notchTuneFrequencyHz() const;`
  - the rewritten `void RxChannel::setShiftFrequency(double offsetHz);` (both branches push `SetRXAShiftFreq` + `RXANBPSetShiftFrequency`)

- Produces (relied on by Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10):
  - `struct NereusSDR::Notch { int id{0}; double centerHz{0.0}; double widthHz{200.0}; bool active{true}; };` in `src/core/dsp/Notch.h`
  - `int  RXANBPAddNotch(int channel, int notch, double fcenter, double fwidth, int active);`
  - `int  RXANBPGetNotch(int channel, int notch, double* fcenter, double* fwidth, int* active);`
  - `int  RXANBPEditNotch(int channel, int notch, double fcenter, double fwidth, int active);`
  - `int  RXANBPDeleteNotch(int channel, int notch);`
  - `void RXANBPGetNumNotches(int channel, int* nnotches);`
  - `void RXANBPSetNotchesRun(int channel, int run);`
  - `void RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth(int channel, double* minwidth);`
  - `void RXANBPSetAutoIncrease(int channel, int autoincr);`
  - `static constexpr int RxChannel::kMaxNotches = 1024;`
  - `bool   RxChannel::addNotch(int index, const Notch& n);`
  - `bool   RxChannel::editNotch(int index, const Notch& n);`
  - `bool   RxChannel::deleteNotch(int index);`
  - `int    RxChannel::notchCount() const;`
  - `void   RxChannel::syncNotches(const QList<Notch>& notches);`
  - `void   RxChannel::setNotchesRun(bool run);`
  - `bool   RxChannel::notchesRun() const;`
  - `void   RxChannel::setNotchAutoIncrease(bool on);`
  - `bool   RxChannel::notchAutoIncrease() const;`
  - `double RxChannel::minNotchWidthHz() const;`
  - test-only friend seam: `friend class ::TestRxChannelNotchWrappers;` on `WdspEngine`

---

## Cycle 1: the `Notch` value type

Six steps rather than five: the CMake registration is its own action because a test that is not registered cannot be built, so it has to land before the "watch it fail" run.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.cpp`:

```cpp
// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original test infrastructure.  Thetis and WDSP
// file names appear in comments to document what each wrapper forwards to;
// no upstream logic is ported into this file.
// =================================================================
// tests/tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.cpp  (NereusSDR)
// =================================================================
//
// TNF build-order step 2: the Notch value type plus the RxChannel manual
// notch wrappers that carry it into the per-channel WDSP notch database.
//
// Design: docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md
//         §5.1 (Notch), §6.1 (wdsp_api.h declarations), §6.2 (RxChannel).
// =================================================================
#include <QtTest/QtTest>

#include "core/dsp/Notch.h"

using namespace NereusSDR;

class TestRxChannelNotchWrappers : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT

private slots:
    // ── §5.1: the Notch value type ───────────────────────────────────────

    void notch_defaults_to_panadapter_width()
    {
        Notch n;
        QCOMPARE(n.widthHz, 200.0);
    }

    void notch_defaults_to_active()
    {
        Notch n;
        QVERIFY(n.active);
    }

    void notch_defaults_to_unset_id_and_centre()
    {
        Notch n;
        QCOMPARE(n.id, 0);
        QCOMPARE(n.centerHz, 0.0);
    }
};

QTEST_MAIN(TestRxChannelNotchWrappers)
#include "tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.moc"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the test in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`**

Insert after line 5732 (`longpath_add_test(tst_diversity_dialog_persistence)`), before the `# ----` aggregate-target banner at line 5734:

```cmake
# TNF build-order step 2: RxChannel manual-notch wrappers (Notch value type,
# add / edit / delete / sync / count, notches-run, auto-increase, min width).
# Opens ONE real WDSP RX channel through the WdspEngine LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS
# friend seam, because every RXANBP* entry point dereferences rxa[channel].ndb
# and the usual kTestChannel = 99 convention would read out of bounds
# (comm.h:110 sizes rxa at MAX_CHANNELS = 32).
# Source: NereusSDR-original test infrastructure.
# Design: docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md §6.2, §11.1.
longpath_add_test(tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers)
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with `fatal error: 'core/dsp/Notch.h' file not found`

- [ ] **Step 4: Create the `Notch` value type**

Create `src/core/dsp/Notch.h`:

```cpp
// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original struct; the doc comment below names Thetis
// source files only to explain the field-set and default-value provenance, not
// to port code.
#pragma once

namespace NereusSDR {

/// One manual notch, in absolute RF Hz.
///
/// Handed between NotchModel (the owner), RxChannel (the WDSP fan-out) and
/// SpectrumWidget (the marker layer). It lives in core/ rather than models/ so
/// RxChannel can take it by const reference without core acquiring a dependency
/// on models; same placement rationale as dsp/ChannelConfig.h.
///
/// **Field-set provenance.** centerHz / widthHz / active correspond to the three
/// fields of Thetis's MNotch class in radio.cs (FCenter / FWidth / Active). None
/// of MNotch's logic is carried over: its Parse / ToString round-trip exists to
/// fit Thetis's key-value database and NereusSDR persists flat AppSettings keys
/// instead, and its CompareTo has no NereusSDR caller. `id` has no Thetis
/// counterpart at all; Thetis identifies a notch by its position in MNotchDB,
/// which is why every Thetis mutation loses the operator's selection and has to
/// recover it by searching for matching field values.
///
/// **Default width.** 200 Hz is the width Thetis gives a notch created from the
/// panadapter. The authoritative named constant lives on NotchModel; the
/// initialiser here mirrors it so a default-constructed Notch is usable.
///
/// Design: docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md §5.1.
struct Notch {
    int    id{0};           ///< stable, monotonic; UI hit-test and drag key
    double centerHz{0.0};   ///< absolute RF Hz
    double widthHz{200.0};  ///< Hz
    bool   active{true};    ///< per-notch bypass
};

}  // namespace NereusSDR
```

Append one row to the column-2 exclusion table in `docs/attribution/THETIS-PROVENANCE.md`, directly after the `src/core/dsp/TxChannelState.h` row at line 413:

## Cycle 2: the eight `wdsp_api.h` declarations, `notchCount()` and `kMaxNotches`

- [ ] **Step 1: Extend the test with a real opened channel**

Replace the include block and add the fixture helpers plus two slots in `tests/tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.cpp`.

Includes (replace the single `#include "core/dsp/Notch.h"` line):

```cpp
#include <QtTest/QtTest>

#include <QList>

#include "core/RxChannel.h"
#include "core/WdspEngine.h"
#include "core/dsp/Notch.h"
#include "core/wdsp_api.h"

using namespace NereusSDR;

namespace {

// A real WDSP channel id, not the usual kTestChannel = 99 sentinel.  Every
// RXANBP* entry point dereferences rxa[channel].ndb before it range-checks
// anything (nbp.c:367, :397, :424, :450, :469, :479), and rxa is sized
// MAX_CHANNELS = 32 (comm.h:110), so 99 is an out-of-bounds read rather than
// a harmless miss.  Design doc §11.1.
constexpr int kNotchTestChannel = 0;

// Geometry the fixture opens the channel with.  Both values are load-bearing
// for the min-notch-width expectation in the last cycle: WDSP derives the
// filter's coefficient count as max(2048, dsp_size) (RXA.c:96) and reads the
// rate straight off the channel (RXA.c:102).
constexpr int kDspBufferSize   = 4096;
constexpr int kDspSampleRateHz = 48000;

// Closes the opened WDSP channel however the scope is left.  QCOMPARE /
// QVERIFY return from the enclosing slot on failure, so a trailing
// destroyRxChannel() would be skipped on exactly the run where a leaked
// rxa[0] slot would poison every later slot.
struct ChannelCloser {
    WdspEngine* engine{nullptr};
    ~ChannelCloser() {
        if (engine) { engine->destroyRxChannel(kNotchTestChannel); }
    }
};

#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
// One notch read straight out of the WDSP database, bypassing the wrapper
// under test.  nbp.c:393 returns -1 and writes fcenter = -1.0 past the end.
struct RawNotch {
    double centerHz{0.0};
    double widthHz{0.0};
    int    active{-1};
    int    rval{-1};
};

RawNotch readRawNotch(int channelId, int index)
{
    RawNotch n;
    n.rval = RXANBPGetNotch(channelId, index, &n.centerHz, &n.widthHz, &n.active);
    return n;
}
#endif

} // namespace
```

Add the fixture helper and the two new slots to the class (helper first, as a plain private member function so QtTest does not treat it as a test):

```cpp
class TestRxChannelNotchWrappers : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT

private:
    // Primes the engine past its async wisdom load (the LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS
    // friend seam on WdspEngine) and opens one real RX channel, so
    // rxa[kNotchTestChannel].ndb exists.  Same pattern as
    // tests/tst_ps_feedback_channel.cpp:72,78.
    RxChannel* openNotchChannel(WdspEngine& engine)
    {
        engine.m_initialized = true;   // friend access (LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS)
        return engine.createRxChannel(kNotchTestChannel,
                                      /*inputBufferSize*/ 238,
                                      /*dspBufferSize*/ kDspBufferSize,
                                      /*inputSampleRate*/ kDspSampleRateHz,
                                      /*dspSampleRate*/ kDspSampleRateHz,
                                      /*outputSampleRate*/ kDspSampleRateHz);
    }

private slots:
    // ... the three Cycle 1 slots stay exactly as they are ...

    // ── §6.2: notch capacity and count readback ──────────────────────────

    void max_notches_matches_the_wdsp_database_size()
    {
        // create_notchdb is called with maxnotches = 1024 for every RXA
        // channel (RXA.c:88); RXANBPAddNotch refuses past it (nbp.c:368).
        QCOMPARE(RxChannel::kMaxNotches, 1024);
    }

    void fresh_channel_reports_zero_notches()
    {
#ifndef HAVE_WDSP
        QSKIP("Requires a live WDSP build: the notch database is rxa[].ndb.");
#else
        WdspEngine engine;
        RxChannel* ch = openNotchChannel(engine);
        ChannelCloser closer{&engine};
        QVERIFY(ch != nullptr);

        QCOMPARE(ch->notchCount(), 0);
#endif
    }
};
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with `error: 'm_initialized' is a private member of 'NereusSDR::WdspEngine'`, `error: no member named 'kMaxNotches' in 'NereusSDR::RxChannel'`, `error: no member named 'notchCount' in 'NereusSDR::RxChannel'`, and `error: use of undeclared identifier 'RXANBPGetNotch'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Declare the eight WDSP entry points, open the friend seam, add `notchCount()` and `kMaxNotches`**

`src/core/wdsp_api.h` ,  append a modification-history entry immediately before the closing `// ====` at line 136:

```cpp
//   2026-07-29 ,  RXANBPAddNotch, RXANBPGetNotch, RXANBPEditNotch,

//                 RXANBPSetNotchesRun, RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth,
//                 RXANBPSetAutoIncrease declarations added by J.J. Boyd
//                 (KG4VCF) during the Tunable Notch Filter epic, build-order
//                 step 2 ,  the RxChannel manual-notch wrappers.  Signatures
//                 match wdsp/nbp.c:362, 393, 444, 418, 465, 499, 594, 604
//                 [v2.10.3.15]; managed-side P/Invoke decls are
//                 Console/dsp.cs:703-737 [v2.10.3.15].  None of the eight are
//                 declared in the vendored third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.h, which
//                 exports only RXANBPSetFreqs / SetNC / SetMP (nbp.h:96-100) , 
//                 same situation as the existing RXANBPSetShiftFrequency decl.
//                 AI-assisted transformation via Anthropic Claude Code.
```

`src/core/wdsp_api.h` ,  insert this block inside the `extern "C" { ... }` region, immediately after Task 1's `RXANBPSetTuneFrequency` declaration (which sits under `void RXANBPSetShiftFrequency(int channel, double shift);` at line 357):

```cpp
// =====================================================================
// Manual notch filter ,  per-channel notch database (WDSP nbp.c)
// From Thetis Project Files/Source/Console/dsp.cs:703-737 [v2.10.3.15] , 
// P/Invoke declarations.  Thetis marshals `active` / `run` / `autoincr` as
// C# bool, which DllImport marshals as a 4-byte Win32 BOOL; the C signatures
// below take int, which is the same wire value.
//
// The vendored third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.h declares only RXANBPSetFreqs (:96),
// RXANBPSetNC (:98) and RXANBPSetMP (:100).  Every entry point below is
// PORT-exported from nbp.c but absent from that header, which is why it has
// to be declared here.  RXANBPSetNC is deliberately NOT declared: the route
// to it already exists transitively through RXASetNC (RXA.c:1043).
// =====================================================================

// nbp.c:362 ,  INSERT at position `notch`.  Returns -1 and mutates nothing
// when notch > nn or the database is already full (RXA.c:88 sizes it at

int RXANBPAddNotch(int channel, int notch, double fcenter, double fwidth,
                   int active);

// nbp.c:393 ,  readback.  Returns -1 and writes fcenter = -1.0, fwidth = 0.0,
// active = -1 when notch >= nn.
int RXANBPGetNotch(int channel, int notch, double* fcenter, double* fwidth,
                   int* active);

// nbp.c:444 ,  overwrite in place.  Returns -1 when notch >= nn.
int RXANBPEditNotch(int channel, int notch, double fcenter, double fwidth,
                    int active);

// nbp.c:418 ,  erase and shift the remaining entries down one slot.  Returns
// -1 when notch >= nn.
int RXANBPDeleteNotch(int channel, int notch);

// nbp.c:465
void RXANBPGetNumNotches(int channel, int* nnotches);

// nbp.c:499 ,  the ONLY writer of notchdb.master_run.  RXA.c:86-88 builds

void RXANBPSetNotchesRun(int channel, int run);

// nbp.c:594 ,  narrowest notch the current filter can realise.  Varies with
// the filter's coefficient count and sample rate (min_notch_width,

void RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth(int channel, double* minwidth);

// nbp.c:604
void RXANBPSetAutoIncrease(int channel, int autoincr);
```

`src/core/WdspEngine.h` ,  add the global-scope forward declaration after line 123 (`class TestWdspChannelIdMap;`), inside the existing `#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` block:

```cpp
// Tunable Notch Filter step 2: the notch-wrapper test opens one real RX
// channel so the RXANBP* entry points have an rxa[].ndb to dereference.
class TestRxChannelNotchWrappers;
```

`src/core/WdspEngine.h` ,  add the friend after line 694 (`friend class ::TestWdspChannelIdMap;`):

```cpp
    // Tunable Notch Filter step 2: same friendship for the notch-wrapper
    // test, which primes m_initialized so createRxChannel opens a real
    // WDSP channel with a real notch database.
    friend class ::TestRxChannelNotchWrappers;
```

`src/core/RxChannel.h` ,  add the include after line 200 (`#include "dsp/ChannelConfig.h"`):

```cpp
#include "dsp/Notch.h"
```

and after line 211 (`#include <QObject>`):

```cpp
#include <QList>
```

`src/core/RxChannel.h` ,  add the public notch API immediately after Task 1's `notchTuneFrequencyHz()` declaration in the frequency-shift block:

```cpp
    // --- Manual notch filter (TNF) ---
    //
    // WDSP owns the authoritative per-channel notch database; RxChannel is a
    // thin forwarder.  List position IS the WDSP notch index, so every caller
    // must keep its own ordering in lockstep (design doc §5.2).
    //
    // WDSP builds each RXA channel's database with room for 1024 notches
    // (third_party/wdsp/src/RXA.c:88).  RXANBPAddNotch returns -1 and mutates
    // nothing once nn reaches that (nbp.c:368).
    static constexpr int kMaxNotches = 1024;

    /// Number of notches currently installed on this channel.
    int notchCount() const;
```

`src/core/RxChannel.cpp` ,  add a new section immediately after Task 1's `RxChannel::setNotchTuneFrequency` definition, before the `// Channel state` banner:

```cpp
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Manual notch filter (TNF) ,  per-channel WDSP notch database
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

int RxChannel::notchCount() const
{
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis console.cs:40265 [v2.10.3.15] ,  AddNotch reads the count
    // back out of WDSP before it picks an insert index.
    // WDSP: third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:465
    int n = 0;
    RXANBPGetNumNotches(m_channelId, &n);
    return n;
#else
    return 0;
#endif
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (5 slots)

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash

git commit -S -m "feat(wdsp): declare the eight RXANBP notch entry points and read the notch count"
```

---

## Cycle 3: `addNotch`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add two slots to `TestRxChannelNotchWrappers`:

```cpp
    // ── §6.2: add ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    void add_notch_appends_in_list_order()
    {
#ifndef HAVE_WDSP
        QSKIP("Requires a live WDSP build: the notch database is rxa[].ndb.");
#else

        QVERIFY(ch != nullptr);

        QVERIFY(ch->addNotch(0, Notch{1, 14074000.0, 200.0, true}));
        QVERIFY(ch->addNotch(1, Notch{2, 14100000.0, 100.0, true}));
        QVERIFY(ch->addNotch(2, Notch{3, 14200000.0, 500.0, false}));

        QCOMPARE(ch->notchCount(), 3);

        const RawNotch first = readRawNotch(kNotchTestChannel, 0);
        QCOMPARE(first.rval, 0);
        QCOMPARE(first.centerHz, 14074000.0);
        QCOMPARE(first.widthHz, 200.0);
        QCOMPARE(first.active, 1);

        const RawNotch third = readRawNotch(kNotchTestChannel, 2);

        QCOMPARE(third.centerHz, 14200000.0);
        QCOMPARE(third.widthHz, 500.0);
        QCOMPARE(third.active, 0);
#endif
    }

    void add_notch_past_the_end_is_rejected_without_mutating()
    {
#ifndef HAVE_WDSP
        QSKIP("Requires a live WDSP build: the notch database is rxa[].ndb.");
#else
        WdspEngine engine;
        RxChannel* ch = openNotchChannel(engine);
        ChannelCloser closer{&engine};
        QVERIFY(ch != nullptr);

        QVERIFY(ch->addNotch(0, Notch{1, 7040000.0, 200.0, true}));

        // nbp.c:368 guards on `notch <= b->nn`, so index 1 is legal (append)
        // and index 2 is not.  The -1 must reach the caller, not be swallowed.
        QVERIFY(!ch->addNotch(2, Notch{2, 7050000.0, 200.0, true}));
        QCOMPARE(ch->notchCount(), 1);
#endif
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with `error: no member named 'addNotch' in 'NereusSDR::RxChannel'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `addNotch`**

`src/core/RxChannel.h` ,  add after the `notchCount()` declaration:

```cpp
    /// Insert `n` at WDSP notch index `index`.  Returns false when WDSP
    /// refuses (index past the end, or kMaxNotches reached), in which case
    /// nothing was mutated and the caller should resync.
    bool addNotch(int index, const Notch& n);
```

`src/core/RxChannel.cpp` ,  add above `notchCount()`:

```cpp
bool RxChannel::addNotch(int index, const Notch& n)

#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From Thetis console.cs:40271-40273 [v2.10.3.15] ,  AddNotch pushes the

    // WDSP: third_party/wdsp/src/nbp.c:362 ,  an INSERT guarded by
    // `notch <= b->nn && b->nn < b->maxnotches`; returns -1 with no mutation
    // otherwise.
    const int rval = RXANBPAddNotch(m_channelId, index, n.centerHz, n.widthHz,
                                    n.active ? 1 : 0);
    if (rval < 0) {

        return false;
    }
    return true;
#else
    Q_UNUSED(index);
    Q_UNUSED(n);
    return false;
#endif
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (7 slots)

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/core/RxChannel.h src/core/RxChannel.cpp tests/tst_rxchannel_notch_wrappers.cpp
git commit -S -m "feat(dsp): add RxChannel::addNotch and surface the WDSP rejection"

## Cycle 4: `editNotch` and `deleteNotch`

### Task 3: NotchModel: guards, clear() contract, persistence, pure helpers

**Files:**
- Create: `src/models/NotchModel.h`
- Create: `src/models/NotchModel.cpp`
- Modify: `CMakeLists.txt:657-673` (add `src/models/NotchModel.cpp` to `MODEL_SOURCES`)
- Modify: `docs/attribution/THETIS-PROVENANCE.md:315-316` (insert two rows, alphabetical, between `BandDefaults.cpp` and `PanadapterModel.cpp`)
- Modify: `docs/attribution/aethersdr-reconciliation.md:88-89` (insert two rows in the Models table)
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt:5732` (append five `longpath_add_test` registrations)
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_model_guards.cpp`
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_model_index_invariant.cpp`
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_spatial_helpers.cpp`
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_sideband_shift.cpp`
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_persistence.cpp`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes (from Task 2):
  - `struct NereusSDR::Notch { int id{0}; double centerHz{0.0}; double widthHz{200.0}; bool active{true}; };` declared in `src/core/dsp/Notch.h`
  - `void RxChannel::syncNotches(const QList<Notch>& notches);` (not called here; establishes that `Notch` is reachable from `core/`)

- Produces (relied on by Tasks 4 through 10):
  - `class NereusSDR::NotchModel : public QObject` in `src/models/NotchModel.h`
  - `explicit NotchModel(QObject* parent = nullptr);`
  - `const QList<Notch>& notches() const;`
  - `const Notch* notchById(int id) const;`
  - `int indexOfId(int id) const;`
  - `bool globalEnabled() const;` / `bool autoIncrease() const;` / `bool visualEnabled() const;` / `bool adminBusy() const;`
  - `bool notchNearFreq(double hz, int deltaHz) const;`
  - `QList<Notch> notchesInBandwidth(double centreHz, int lowHz, int highHz) const;`
  - `const Notch* notchSurrounding(double centreHz, int lowHz, int highHz, double hz, int padWidthHz = 0) const;`
  - `static int notchSidebandShift(int filterLowHz, int filterHighHz);`
  - `int addNotch(double centerHz, double widthHz = kDefaultNotchWidthHz);`
  - `bool setCenter(int id, double centerHz);` / `bool setWidth(int id, double widthHz);` / `bool setActive(int id, bool active);` / `bool removeNotch(int id);`
  - `void setGlobalEnabled(bool on);` / `void setAutoIncrease(bool on);` / `void setVisualEnabled(bool on);` / `void setAdminBusy(bool busy);` / `void clear();`
  - `void saveToSettings() const;` / `void restoreFromSettings();`
  - signals `notchAdded(int)`, `notchChanged(int)`, `notchRemoved(int, int)`, `globalEnabledChanged(bool)`, `autoIncreaseChanged(bool)`, `visualEnabledChanged(bool)`, `notchAddRejected(const QString&)`, `notchesReset()`
  - constants `kNotchDedupeWindowHz`, `kDefaultNotchWidthHz`, `kNarrowNotchWidthHz`, `kMaxNotchWidthHz`, `kMinNotchCentreHz`, `kMaxNotchCentreHz`

> **Plan note on the header.** `NotchModel.h` lands complete in Cycle 1 because §5.3 is the published contract Tasks 4 through 10 consume and later tasks must not be blocked on header churn. The `.cpp` fills in across the six cycles below, so every cycle after the first fails at **link** time with a named undefined symbol before its implementation lands. That is a real, specific, reproducible red.

// per rx index; a global, slice-agnostic NotchModel cannot, so the caller
// supplies the active slice's edges (SliceModel::filterLow() / filterHigh()).
//
// The Thetis CW-pitch term is deliberately absent (design §1.2): upstream
// TNFAdd's +cw_pitch and AddNotch's -cw_pitch cancel, and NereusSDR keeps the
// CW pitch in the filter passband rather than on the DDC, so this shift alone
// is already correct.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the test and add the `WdspEngine` friend seam**

Append after `tests/CMakeLists.txt:5732` (`longpath_add_test(tst_diversity_dialog_persistence)`), before the `# Aggregate "all_tests" target` block:

```cmake
# ── TNF Task 4: RadioModel notch fan-out + syncNotchesToAllChannels() ──────

longpath_add_test(tst_notch_channel_sync)
```

Insert after `src/core/WdspEngine.h:123` (`class TestWdspChannelIdMap;`), inside the existing `#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` block:

```cpp
// TNF Task 4: the notch fan-out test primes the engine so openRxChannelPool

Insert after `src/core/WdspEngine.h:694` (`friend class ::TestWdspChannelIdMap;`):

```cpp

    friend class ::TestNotchChannelSync;
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with `error: no member named 'notchModel' in 'NereusSDR::RadioModel'` at `tests/tst_notch_channel_sync.cpp` in `radio_model_owns_one_notch_model`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Give `RadioModel` the `NotchModel` member, accessor and ctor restore**

`src/models/RadioModel.h`, insert after line 131 (`class WdspEngine;`):

```cpp
class RxChannel;
```

`src/models/RadioModel.h`, insert after line 185 (`class RxDecodeModel;`):

```cpp
// TNF (design §5): the canonical notch store, owned by RadioModel alongside
// SpotModel. One list shared by every slice (design D1) because notch centres

class NotchModel;
```

```cpp
    // ── TNF (design §8.1): the canonical notch store ────────────────────────

```

`src/models/RadioModel.h`, insert after line 3078 (`std::unique_ptr<PskReporterClient> m_pskReporter;`):

```cpp

```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (2 slots).

```

#### Cycle B: `RxChannel` notch readback seams

- [ ] **Step 7: Write the failing test**

Append this slot to `TestNotchChannelSync` in `tests/tst_notch_channel_sync.cpp`, after `notch_model_is_restored_at_construction()`:

```cpp
    // ── §6.2 + §11: the readbacks the fan-out tests assert through ───────
    //
    // notchesRun() / notchAutoIncrease() are C++ carries (the §4.6 pattern:
    // written outside #ifdef HAVE_WDSP), because WDSP exposes no getter for
    // NOTCHDB::master_run or NBP::autoincr. notchAt() is the real thing:
    // RXANBPGetNotch reads WDSP's own per-channel database back (nbp.c:393),
    // so it proves a push landed rather than echoing a carry.
    void rx_channel_reports_back_the_notch_state_it_was_handed()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        WdspEngine* engine = model.wdspEngine();
        engine->m_initialized = true;   // friend access (LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS)

        model.configureStreamPool(5, 5, 192000);
        const int a = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(a)->setFrequency(14074500.0);
        model.openRxChannelPool(5, bufferSizeForRate(192000), 192000);

        RxChannel* ch = engine->rxChannel(a);
        QVERIFY(ch != nullptr);

        ch->setNotchesRun(true);
        QVERIFY(ch->notchesRun());
        ch->setNotchesRun(false);
        QVERIFY(!ch->notchesRun());

        QVERIFY(ch->notchAutoIncrease());
        ch->setNotchAutoIncrease(false);
        QVERIFY(!ch->notchAutoIncrease());

        Notch n;
        n.centerHz = 14074000.0;
        n.widthHz  = 250.0;
        n.active   = true;
        QVERIFY(ch->addNotch(0, n));
        QCOMPARE(ch->notchCount(), 1);

        Notch got;
        QVERIFY(ch->notchAt(0, got));
        QCOMPARE(got.centerHz, 14074000.0);
        QCOMPARE(got.widthHz,  250.0);

        // Past the end: RXANBPGetNotch returns -1 and writes its sentinels
        // (nbp.c:406-411), so the wrapper must report failure, not garbage.
        QVERIFY(!ch->notchAt(1, got));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time with `error: no member named 'notchesRun' in 'NereusSDR::RxChannel'` at `tests/tst_notch_channel_sync.cpp`.

- [ ] **Step 9: Add the three readbacks to `RxChannel`**

`src/core/RxChannel.h`, in the public notch block introduced by Task 2, immediately after `double notchTuneFrequencyHz() const;`:

```cpp
    // Carried copies of the two per-channel notch flags. WDSP exposes no
    // getter for NOTCHDB::master_run (nbp.c:499 is a pure writer) or
    // NBP::autoincr (nbp.c:604), so the carry is the only readback, and it is
    // written outside #ifdef HAVE_WDSP exactly as setShiftFrequency writes
    // m_shiftOffsetHz (RxChannel.cpp:1468-1477).
    bool notchesRun() const { return m_notchesRun; }
    bool notchAutoIncrease() const { return m_notchAutoIncrease; }

    // Read one notch straight back out of WDSP's per-channel database.
    // From WDSP nbp.c:393 (RXANBPGetNotch): 0 on success, -1 with sentinel
    // outputs when `index` is past the end. `out.id` is left untouched --
    // WDSP's database is positional and carries no id (design D4).
    bool notchAt(int index, Notch& out) const;
```

`src/core/RxChannel.h`, in the private member block, immediately after `double m_notchTuneFrequencyHz{0.0};` (added by Task 1 alongside `m_shiftOffsetHz` at `:936-938`):

```cpp
    // Notch flag carries. Main thread only: nothing in the audio callback
    // reads them, so no atomics, for the same reason m_nr1Tuning is a plain
    // member -- WDSP holds the authoritative state for the audio thread.
    bool m_notchesRun{false};
    bool m_notchAutoIncrease{false};
```

`src/core/RxChannel.cpp`, in the notch block introduced by Task 2, replace the two flag setters with the carry-then-guard form and add `notchAt`:

```cpp
void RxChannel::setNotchesRun(bool run)
{
    m_notchesRun = run;
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From WDSP nbp.c:499 -- the only writer of NOTCHDB::master_run and

    // (nbp.c:223) bypass the notch database entirely while fnfrun is 0, and
    // the database is created inert (RXA.c:85-93), so a channel that never
    // sees this call is notch-inert, not merely empty.
    RXANBPSetNotchesRun(m_channelId, run ? 1 : 0);
#endif
}

void RxChannel::setNotchAutoIncrease(bool on)
{
    m_notchAutoIncrease = on;
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    // From WDSP nbp.c:604 -- widens a notch narrower than the achievable
    // minimum rather than silently under-delivering (nbp.c:122,
    // "if (autoincr && width[k] < minwidth)").
    RXANBPSetAutoIncrease(m_channelId, on ? 1 : 0);
#endif
}

bool RxChannel::notchAt(int index, Notch& out) const
{
#ifdef HAVE_WDSP
    double centerHz = 0.0;
    double widthHz  = 0.0;
    int    active   = 0;
    // From WDSP nbp.c:393 -- returns 0 on success; on -1 it writes
    // fcenter -1.0 / fwidth 0.0 / active -1, which must not reach the caller.
    if (RXANBPGetNotch(m_channelId, index, &centerHz, &widthHz, &active) != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    out.centerHz = centerHz;
    out.widthHz  = widthHz;
    out.active   = (active != 0);
    return true;
#else
    Q_UNUSED(index);
    Q_UNUSED(out);
    return false;
#endif
}
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

#### Cycle D: the `activateSliceChannel` hook for a later-added slice

- [ ] **Step 17: Write the failing test**

Append this slot to `TestNotchChannelSync`:

```cpp
    // ── §6.3: "keep the activateSliceChannel hook for the later-added-slice
    // case". The discriminating sequence is a notch added AFTER the pool
    // reconcile: the live fan-out walks slices(), and slice B does not exist
    // yet, so channel 1 is left open, bound to nothing and empty. Binding B
    // is the only remaining chance to seed it.
    void a_slice_added_after_a_live_notch_add_inherits_the_set()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        WdspEngine* engine = model.wdspEngine();
        engine->m_initialized = true;

        model.configureStreamPool(5, 5, 192000);
        const int a = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(a)->setFrequency(14074500.0);
        model.openRxChannelPool(5, bufferSizeForRate(192000), 192000);

        NotchModel* nm = model.notchModel();
        nm->setGlobalEnabled(true);
        nm->setAutoIncrease(true);
        QVERIFY(nm->addNotch(14074000.0, 200.0) >= 0);

        const int b = model.addSlice();
        model.sliceById(b)->setFrequency(14076000.0);
        QVERIFY(model.sliceById(b)->streamIndex() >= 0);

        RxChannel* ch = engine->rxChannel(b);
        QVERIFY(ch != nullptr);
        QCOMPARE(ch->notchCount(), 1);
        QVERIFY(ch->notchesRun());
        QVERIFY(ch->notchAutoIncrease());
        QCOMPARE(ch->notchTuneFrequencyHz(),
                 model.streamCentreHzForTest(model.sliceById(b)->streamIndex()));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 18: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at runtime in `a_slice_added_after_a_live_notch_add_inherits_the_set` with `Compared values are not the same / Actual (ch->notchCount()): 0 / Expected (1)`.

Note: the `nm->addNotch(...)` call above does not yet reach any channel either (Cycle E wires that), so this slot fails on slice B alone, which is exactly the hook under test.

- [ ] **Step 19: Add the notch reconcile to `activateSliceChannel`**

`src/models/RadioModel.cpp`, insert between line 3144 (`ch->setShiftFrequency(slice->shiftOffsetHz());`) and line 3146 (`ch->setActive(true);`):

```cpp
    // TNF design §6.3: the notch set, the master run flag, the auto-increase
    // flag and the NBP tune frequency. syncNotchesToAllChannels covers every
    // channel the pool opened, but a slice added afterwards binds to a channel
    // that has been sitting open and unreconciled since, and the signal
    // fan-out only walks slices that already exist. This is the hook for that
    // case. No-op on retune, because the early return above already fired.
    syncNotchesToChannel(ch, slice->sliceIndex());
```

- [ ] **Step 20: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (6 slots).

- [ ] **Step 21: Commit**

```bash

- [ ] **Step 25: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_channel_sync && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_channel_sync$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (12 slots).

- [ ] **Step 26: Re-run the stream-pool suite to prove the pool tail did not regress**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_stream_pool_binding tst_wdsp_channel_id_map && ctest --test-dir build -R '^(tst_stream_pool_binding|tst_wdsp_channel_id_map)$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (both were already green; `openRxChannelPool` and `activateSliceChannel` both gained a call).

- [ ] **Step 27: Commit**

```bash
git add src/models/RadioModel.h src/models/RadioModel.cpp tests/tst_notch_channel_sync.cpp
git commit -m "feat(notch): fan NotchModel mutations out to every live RX channel"

### Task 5: TCI repoint and both-index broadcast

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable.cpp`
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt:5733` (register the new test, before the `all_tests` aggregate block at `:5734`)
- Modify: `src/models/RadioModel.h:1684-1695` (doc comment above `setRxNf` / `rxNf`)
- Modify: `src/models/RadioModel.h:2867-2872` (stub-array doc comment)
- Modify: `src/models/RadioModel.h:2904` (delete the dead `m_tciStubRxNf` array)
- Modify: `src/models/RadioModel.cpp:11412-11420` (`setRxNf` / `rxNf` bodies)
- Modify: `src/core/TciProtocol.cpp:2170-2177` (drop the handler's single-index push)
- Modify: `tests/data/tci/matrix.csv:36` (`rx_nf_enable_set_rx0` expected_notifications)
- Modify: `docs/architecture/2026-05-09-phase3j-1-tci-port-verification/README.md` (regenerated, not hand-edited)
- Modify: `src/core/TciServer.h:122` (add `protocolForTest()` after `peekTxRingSize()`)
- Modify: `src/core/TciServer.h:427` (add `m_notchBroadcastWired` after `m_globalBroadcastsWired`)
- Modify: `src/core/TciServer.cpp:27` (add `#include "models/NotchModel.h"`)
- Modify: `src/core/TciServer.cpp:603` (append the one-shot wire to `hookSliceBroadcasts()`)
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable.cpp`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (Task 3, `src/models/NotchModel.h`): `bool NotchModel::globalEnabled() const;` / `void NotchModel::setGlobalEnabled(bool on);` / `void NotchModel::globalEnabledChanged(bool on);` (signal, emitted only on change)
- Consumes (Task 4): `NotchModel* RadioModel::notchModel() const;` and the `#include "models/NotchModel.h"` already present in `src/models/RadioModel.cpp`
- Consumes (pre-existing): `void TciProtocol::enqueueLocalBroadcast(const QString& frame);` (`TciProtocol.h:113`), `bool TciProtocol::hasPendingNotification() const;` / `QString TciProtocol::takePendingNotification();` (`TciProtocol.h:81-82`), `void TciServer::hookSliceBroadcasts();` (`TciServer.h:268`)
- Produces: `TciProtocol* TciServer::protocolForTest() const;` (public test seam, returns the owned instance); `void RadioModel::setRxNf(int rx, bool on);` and `bool RadioModel::rxNf(int rx) const;` now backed by `NotchModel::globalEnabled` instead of `m_tciStubRxNf[]`; the wire-frame pair `rx_nf_enable:0,<bool>;` + `rx_nf_enable:1,<bool>;` queued on every `NotchModel::globalEnabledChanged`; private `bool TciServer::m_notchBroadcastWired{false};`

Plan comments on choices the spec left open:
- Spec §6.4 names no seam for observing the outbound queue. Adding `TciServer::protocolForTest()` follows the in-tree `ForTest` convention and the existing test-only members on this same class (`peekTxRingSize()` at `TciServer.h:122`, `injectAudioFrameForTest` at `:140`). It keeps the test free of a real socket and of the 5 ms drain timer, so nothing sleeps.
- Spec §6.4 says "one-shot" without naming the mechanism. `hookSliceBroadcasts()` runs from the constructor (`TciServer.cpp:467`) **and** from every `start()` (`TciServer.cpp:1191`), and `stop()`'s `QObject::disconnect(m_model, nullptr, this, nullptr)` (`TciServer.cpp:1220`) is rooted on `RadioModel`, so it cannot reach a `NotchModel`-rooted connection. A `bool m_notchBroadcastWired` that is set once and **never reset in `stop()`** is therefore the correct guard; resetting it (as `m_globalBroadcastsWired` does) would double-wire on restart.
- Spec §6.4 does not mention `tests/data/tci/matrix.csv:36`, whose `expected_notifications` cell pins the exact single-index push §6.4 orders dropped. `tst_tci_matrix_runner` asserts that cell (`QCOMPARE(notifs.join("|"), r.expectedNotifs)`), so the row must be updated in the same commit or the suite goes red.
- Spec does not say what becomes of the now-dead `m_tciStubRxNf[]` array or of out-of-range `rx`. The array is deleted (it has no other reader), and the shims keep Thetis's 0..1 receiver guard from `TCIServer.cs:3388` / `console.cs:52320 [v2.10.3.15]`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the test, run it, watch it fail**

Insert immediately after `longpath_add_test(tst_diversity_dialog_persistence)` at `tests/CMakeLists.txt:5733`, before the `# Aggregate "all_tests" target` banner (the aggregate reads a GLOBAL property, so registrations must precede it):

```cmake

# Verifies the TCI master-notch surface against the real NotchModel:

endif()
```

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL. Compiles clean (both `notchModel()` and the shims already exist), then fails at runtime in `set_on_rx0_flips_the_master_enable` with `'m.notchModel()->globalEnabled()' returned FALSE` at the line after `handleCommand("rx_nf_enable:0,true;")`, because `RadioModel::setRxNf` still writes `m_tciStubRxNf[0]`. `query_reports_the_master_enable_on_both_indices` fails the same way with `Compared values are not the same / Actual: "rx_nf_enable:0,false;" / Expected: "rx_nf_enable:0,true;"`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Repoint `setRxNf` / `rxNf` at `NotchModel`**

`src/models/RadioModel.cpp:11412-11420`, replace both bodies:

```cpp
// TNF §6.4: rx_nf_enable is the master notch enable, not a per-rx stub.
// Thetis addresses it as rx 0|1 on the wire but the flag itself is global:
// GetMNF returns Console.TNFActive for either index
// (console.cs:52317-52326 [v2.10.3.15]) and the set branch writes that one
// property (TCIServer.cs:3397 [v2.10.3.15]).
//   // mnf enabled globally  [original inline comment from console.cs:52319]
void RadioModel::setRxNf(int rx, bool on)
{
    // From Thetis TCIServer.cs:3388 [v2.10.3.15] ,  "if (rx < 0 || rx > 1) return;"
    if (rx < 0 || rx > 1) { return; }
    if (m_notchModel) { m_notchModel->setGlobalEnabled(on); }
}
bool RadioModel::rxNf(int rx) const
{
    // From Thetis console.cs:52320 [v2.10.3.15] ,  "if (rx < 1 || rx > 2) return false;"
    // Thetis indexes receivers 1-based there; TCI hands us the 0-based index.
    if (rx < 0 || rx > 1) { return false; }
    return m_notchModel && m_notchModel->globalEnabled();
}
```

`src/models/RadioModel.h:1684-1695`, extend the block comment so the exception is visible at the declaration:

```cpp
    // ── Stub categories: SliceModel doesn't expose these as Q_PROPERTYs yet ─
    // Each stub stores the requested value in a small per-slice array so
    // round-trip (set then get) returns the operator's last value.  Real
    // wiring to WDSP comes when the underlying feature lands.
    Q_INVOKABLE void setRxBin(int rx, bool on);
    Q_INVOKABLE bool rxBin(int rx) const;
    Q_INVOKABLE void setRxApf(int rx, bool on);
    Q_INVOKABLE bool rxApf(int rx) const;
    // NOT a stub since TNF §6.4: these read and write the NotchModel master
    // enable.  Global despite the per-rx command shape, exactly as Thetis
    // GetMNF is (console.cs:52317-52326 [v2.10.3.15]).
    Q_INVOKABLE void setRxNf(int rx, bool on);
    Q_INVOKABLE bool rxNf(int rx) const;
    Q_INVOKABLE void setRxEnable(int rx, bool on);
    Q_INVOKABLE bool rxEnable(int rx) const;
```

`src/models/RadioModel.h:2867-2871`, drop `rxNf` from the stub roster:

```cpp
    // Per-slice stub state for DSP toggles SliceModel doesn't yet expose
    // as Q_PROPERTYs: rxBin / rxApf / rxEnable.  Sized to the max
    // RX count NereusSDR supports today (4 for the four-DDC SKUs); the
    // setter clamps the index so an out-of-range slice silently no-ops.
    // rxNf left this set in TNF §6.4: it is the global notch master enable
    // and now reads and writes NotchModel::globalEnabled.
    static constexpr int kTciStubSliceMax = 4;
```

`src/models/RadioModel.h:2904`, delete the now-unread array (this exact line, leaving the four siblings):

```cpp
    std::array<bool, kTciStubSliceMax> m_tciStubRxNf{};
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (4 slots).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/models/RadioModel.h src/models/RadioModel.cpp \
        tests/tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable.cpp tests/CMakeLists.txt
git commit -m "fix(tci): repoint rx_nf_enable at the real notch master enable"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test for the dropped self-notification**

Append this slot to `tests/tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable.cpp`, after `out_of_range_rx_index_leaves_the_master_enable_alone()`:

```cpp
    // ── The set handler must not queue a frame of its own ────────────────

    void set_does_not_queue_its_own_single_index_notification()
    {
        RadioModel m;
        TciProtocol p(&m);
        QVERIFY(m.notchModel());

        p.handleCommand(QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:0,true;"));

        // Thetis's set branch sends nothing (TCIServer.cs:3394-3398
        // [v2.10.3.15]); the wire frames come from TNFChangedHandlers ->
        // OnTnfChanged -> NfChanged, which sends BOTH indices
        // (TCIServer.cs:1315-1320 [v2.10.3.15]).  A single-index push from
        // the handler is a wrong-arity duplicate of that pair.
        const QStringList queued = drain(&p);
        QVERIFY2(queued.isEmpty(),
                 qPrintable(QStringLiteral("handler queued: %1")
                                .arg(queued.join(QLatin1Char('|')))));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL in `set_does_not_queue_its_own_single_index_notification` with `handler queued: rx_nf_enable:0,true;` (the push at `TciProtocol.cpp:2174-2175` is still live).

- [ ] **Step 3: Drop the push and re-pin the matrix row**

`src/core/TciProtocol.cpp:2170-2177`, replace the set branch:

```cpp

`tests/data/tci/matrix.csv:36`, blank the `expected_notifications` cell (fourth field) and restate the notes. Keep the cell text comma-free: `smartSplit` treats an unescaped comma as a field break and `loadMatrix` silently drops the overflow.

```

Regenerate the mirrored table (the README carries a "do not edit by hand" banner):

```bash
python3 scripts/gen-tci-matrix-readme.py \

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run both affected tests, watch them pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable --target tst_tci_matrix_runner && ctest --test-dir build -R '^(tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable|tst_tci_matrix_runner)$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS, 2 tests (5 slots in `tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable`, `allRowsPass` in the matrix runner).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash

git commit -m "fix(tci): drop the redundant single-index rx_nf_enable push"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test for the both-index broadcast**

Append these three slots to `tests/tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable.cpp`, after `set_does_not_queue_its_own_single_index_notification()`:

```cpp
    // ── UI-originated flip broadcasts both indices ───────────────────────

    void ui_flip_broadcasts_both_rx_indices()
    {
        RadioModel m;
        TciServer  server(&m);   // the ctor runs hookSliceBroadcasts()
        TciProtocol* p = server.protocolForTest();
        QVERIFY(p);
        drain(p);                // discard anything queued during wireup

        m.notchModel()->setGlobalEnabled(true);

        // From Thetis TCIServer.cs:1315-1320 [v2.10.3.15] ,  NfChanged calls
        // sendRxNfEnable(0, newState) then sendRxNfEnable(1, newState).
        QCOMPARE(drain(p),
                 (QStringList{QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:0,true;"),
                              QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:1,true;")}));

        m.notchModel()->setGlobalEnabled(false);
        QCOMPARE(drain(p),
                 (QStringList{QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:0,false;"),
                              QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:1,false;")}));
    }

    void repeat_flip_to_the_same_value_broadcasts_nothing()
    {
        RadioModel m;
        TciServer  server(&m);
        TciProtocol* p = server.protocolForTest();
        QVERIFY(p);

        m.notchModel()->setGlobalEnabled(true);
        drain(p);

        // Thetis gates the handler fire on change:
        //   if (old_tnf != value) TNFChangedHandlers?.Invoke(old_tnf, value);
        // (console.cs:40004 [v2.10.3.15]).  NotchModel's change-guarded
        // signal is our equivalent gate.
        m.notchModel()->setGlobalEnabled(true);
        QCOMPARE(drain(p), QStringList());
    }

    void wire_survives_stop_start_without_duplicating()
    {
        RadioModel m;
        TciServer  server(&m);
        TciProtocol* p = server.protocolForTest();
        QVERIFY(p);

        // hookSliceBroadcasts runs from the ctor AND from every start().
        // stop()'s QObject::disconnect(m_model, nullptr, this, nullptr) is
        // rooted on RadioModel, so it cannot sever a NotchModel-rooted
        // connection: without a wire-once guard this would leave three
        // subscribers and emit three frame pairs per flip.
        QVERIFY(server.start(0));
        server.stop();
        QVERIFY(server.start(0));
        server.stop();   // also parks the 5 ms drain timer so the queue is ours
        drain(p);

        m.notchModel()->setGlobalEnabled(true);
        QCOMPARE(drain(p),
                 (QStringList{QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:0,true;"),
                              QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:1,true;")}));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time. `error: no member named 'protocolForTest' in 'NereusSDR::TciServer'` at the first `server.protocolForTest()` call, repeated for all three slots.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the test seam**

`src/core/TciServer.h`, immediately after `peekTxRingSize()` at `:122`:

```cpp
    // Test-only: the shared TciProtocol instance, so a test can inspect the
    // outbound notification queue without binding a socket or spinning the
    // 5ms drain timer.  Used by tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable to assert the
    // both-index rx_nf_enable broadcast.  Never call from production code:
    // TciServer owns the lifetime and the pointer dies with this object.
    TciProtocol* protocolForTest() const { return m_protocol.get(); }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the wire-once guard flag**

`src/core/TciServer.h`, immediately after `bool m_globalBroadcastsWired{false};` at `:427`:

```cpp
    // TNF §6.4: guard flag for the NotchModel master-enable broadcast wired
    // by hookSliceBroadcasts.  Deliberately NOT reset in stop(), unlike
    // m_globalBroadcastsWired above: stop()'s wholesale
    // QObject::disconnect(m_model, nullptr, this, nullptr) is rooted on
    // RadioModel, and NotchModel is a separate QObject, so that connection
    // survives a stop()/start() cycle intact.  hookSliceBroadcasts runs from
    // the constructor AND from every start(), so without this flag each
    // restart would add another subscriber and every flip would emit
    // duplicate rx_nf_enable frames.
    bool m_notchBroadcastWired{false};
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Wire the one-shot broadcast**

`src/core/TciServer.cpp:27`, add after the `models/SliceModel.h` include:

```cpp
#include "models/NotchModel.h"     // TNF §6.4: master notch enable broadcast.
```

`src/core/TciServer.cpp`, append inside `hookSliceBroadcasts()` after the `RadioModel::sliceAdded` connect (currently ending at `:603`) and before the closing brace at `:604`:

```cpp
    // ── Master notch enable (rx_nf_enable:, BOTH rx indices) ────────────────
    // Source: Thetis console.TNFChangedHandlers subscription at
    // TCIServer.cs:6771 [v2.10.3.15], routed to OnTnfChanged
    // (TCIServer.cs:7686-7697 [v2.10.3.15]) which calls NfChanged on every
    // listener; NfChanged sends sendRxNfEnable(0, ...) AND
    // sendRxNfEnable(1, ...) (TCIServer.cs:1315-1320 [v2.10.3.15]) because
    // the flag is global despite the per-rx command shape -- GetMNF returns
    // TNFActive for either index.
    //   // mnf enabled globally  [original inline comment from console.cs:52319]
    //
    // Wired HERE and not in wireSliceForBroadcast because NotchModel is
    // radio-global: wireSliceForBroadcast runs once per slice, so the same
    // connect placed there would emit N frame pairs per flip.
    if (!m_notchBroadcastWired) {
        if (NotchModel* notch = m_model->notchModel()) {
            connect(notch, &NotchModel::globalEnabledChanged, this,
                    [this](bool on) {
                        const QString boolStr = on ? QStringLiteral("true")
                                                   : QStringLiteral("false");
                        m_protocol->enqueueLocalBroadcast(
                            QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:0,%1;").arg(boolStr));
                        m_protocol->enqueueLocalBroadcast(
                            QStringLiteral("rx_nf_enable:1,%1;").arg(boolStr));
                    });
            m_notchBroadcastWired = true;
        }
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (8 slots).

- [ ] **Step 7: Re-run the neighbouring TCI suites for regressions**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tci_matrix_runner --target tst_tci_server_lifecycle --target tst_tci_radio_model_shims --target tst_tci_init_burst_live_state && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tci_' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS. `tst_tci_init_burst_live_state` still asserts `rx_nf_enable:0,true;` alongside `rx_nf_enable:1,false;` and stays green because both init-burst suites bind `TestMockRadioModel`, whose per-index array is untouched by this task.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add src/core/TciServer.h src/core/TciServer.cpp tests/tst_notch_tci_rx_nf_enable.cpp
git commit -m "feat(tci): broadcast the notch master enable on both rx indices"
```

### Task 6: SpectrumWidget notch marker rendering, pushed to every pan

Governing spec: §8.1 (push API), §8.2 (rendering), §12 step 6.

> **Plan comment (scope).** Spec §12 step 6 says "No new test executable; the hit
> test arrives with step 7." Step 7 budgets `tst_notch_hit_test`. This task
> therefore **creates** `tests/tst_notch_hit_test.cpp` and registers it once;
> Task 7 adds its hit-test slots to the same file. Net new executables across
> steps 6 + 7 stays at one, which is what step 6's line is protecting (each test
> binary costs ~38 CPU-s to link).
>
> **Plan comment (`Notch` placement).** The shared contract flags that the spec
> never says whether `Notch` is nested in `NotchModel` or free in `NereusSDR`.
> Task 6 does not need to know: the conversion loops here use `const auto&` over
> `notchModel()->notches()` and touch only `.id` / `.centerHz` / `.widthHz` /
> `.active`, so they compile under either choice Task 3 makes.
>
> **Plan comment (not tested here).** `MainWindow` is deliberately never
> constructed in this suite (see the banner of
> `tests/tst_mainwindow_tools_spot_hub.cpp`), so the `m_panStack` loop itself is
> covered by the §11.2 bench matrix. Cycle 5's test pins the part that can drift
> silently: the `NotchModel` → `NotchMarker` conversion and the every-pan push.

```

and declare it in `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h` beside `drawNotchMarkers`:

from Cycle 2 with:

```cpp

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test and the app build, watch them pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_hit_test && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_hit_test$' --output-on-failure && cmake --build build`

Expected: PASS, and the `NereusSDR` target links.

### Task 7: SpectrumWidget interaction: add, drag, edge-drag, wheel, hover, menus

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/tst_notch_hit_test.cpp`
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt:4331` (append a `longpath_add_test` block after the `tst_spectrum_overlays` registration)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h:176` (add `class QMenu;` to the existing `QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE` forward-decl block)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h:1120-1121` (public test seams, immediately after `spotBgColorForTest()`; after Task 6 this sits at the tail of the notch public block)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h:1199-1200` (five interaction signals, immediately before `protected:`)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h:1322-1323` (private notch helpers, immediately after `showSpotClusterPopup`)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h:1726-1727` (private notch interaction state, immediately after `m_spotSourceVisible`)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:5885-5886` (new notch-interaction block between `specHFromHeight` and `mousePressEvent`)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:5916-5917` (Ctrl add + notch context menu at the head of the `Qt::RightButton` branch)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:6121-6123` (notch press latch, between the freq-scale bar block and the filter-edge block)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:6239-6240` (notch drag branch, between the time-scale drag block and `m_draggingDbm`)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:6452-6454` (notch hover, between the spot hover block and the dBm-strip cursor chain)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:6567-6573` (clear `m_notchGrab` in the release button-clear block)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:6585-6594` (`leaveEvent` clears notch hover state)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:6596-6598` (notch wheel resize at the head of `wheelEvent`)
- Test: `tests/tst_notch_hit_test.cpp`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (from Task 6, `SpectrumWidget` marker rendering, §8.1/§8.2):
  - `struct SpectrumWidget::NotchMarker { int id; double freqMhz; double widthHz; bool active; };`
  - `void SpectrumWidget::setNotchMarkers(const QVector<NotchMarker>& markers);`
  - `void SpectrumWidget::setNotchGlobalEnabled(bool on);`
  - `void SpectrumWidget::setNotchMinWidthHz(double hz);`
  - `QVector<NotchMarker> m_notchMarkers;` (private member)
  - `void SpectrumWidget::drawNotchMarkers(QPainter& p, const QRect& specRect);` (private)
- Consumes (pre-existing, unchanged): `int SpectrumWidget::hzToX(double hz, const QRect& r) const;`, `double SpectrumWidget::xToHz(int x, const QRect& r) const;`, `int SpectrumWidget::effectiveStripW() const;`, `void SpectrumWidget::markOverlayDirty();`, `static int specHFromHeight(int widgetH, float spectrumFrac, int chromeH)` (file-local, `SpectrumWidget.cpp:5876`).
- Produces (Task 8 wires these per pan in `MainWindow`; Task 3's `NotchModel` is the sink):
  - `enum class SpectrumWidget::NotchGrab { None, Centre, LowEdge, HighEdge };`
  - `void SpectrumWidget::notchCreateRequested(double freqHz, bool narrow);` (signal)
  - `void SpectrumWidget::notchMoveRequested(int id, double newFreqHz);` (signal)
  - `void SpectrumWidget::notchWidthRequested(int id, double widthHz);` (signal)
  - `void SpectrumWidget::notchActiveRequested(int id, bool active);` (signal)
  - `void SpectrumWidget::notchRemoveRequested(int id);` (signal)
  - `int SpectrumWidget::notchAtPixelForTest(int x) const;`
  - `NotchGrab SpectrumWidget::notchGrabAtForTest(int id, int x, bool shiftHeld) const;`
  - `int SpectrumWidget::selectedNotchIdForTest() const;`
  - `int SpectrumWidget::hoveredNotchIdForTest() const;`
  - `void SpectrumWidget::buildNotchContextMenuForTest(int id, QMenu& menu);`

**Plan comments (decisions the implementer must not re-litigate):**

1. **`m_selectedNotchId` tracks hover, not "last clicked".** §7.4's inline comment says "last clicked", but the §7 gesture table says "Wheel **over notch**" and the cite it hangs the gate on (`console.cs:31141-31145`) reads `SelectedNotch`, which Thetis assigns from the *hover* hit test on every non-dragging move (`console.cs:49921`). Under a literal "last clicked" reading the wheel would keep resizing a notch after the cursor left it, stealing every scroll on the panadapter, which is the exact failure §7.4 exists to prevent. So: hover writes both ids when not dragging; a left press also writes `m_selectedNotchId` (so a press is self-contained); the press latches `m_notchGrab` and hover stops writing until release. `m_hoveredNotchId` and `m_selectedNotchId` therefore differ only mid-drag, which is the latch §7.3 asks for.
2. **Notch press precedence sits between the freq-scale bar and the filter edges.** Thetis runs its notch block first in `case MouseButtons.Left:` (`console.cs:48981`), ahead of every filter drag. The dBm strip, divider and freq-scale rows are NereusSDR chrome outside the spectrum plot, so they keep their existing precedence and the notch test is guarded on `my < specH`.
3. **Ctrl is `ControlModifier | MetaModifier`.** On macOS Qt swaps Control and Command, so the physical Ctrl key arrives as `Qt::MetaModifier`. `SpectrumWidget.cpp:6631` already accepts both for the zoom wheel; the add gesture matches that precedent so D2's gesture works on a Mac trackpad, which is the whole reason §7.1 picked it.
4. **Hover readout uses `QToolTip`, not a `QLabel` popup.** AetherSDR's `m_tnfHoverPopup` is a styled `QLabel`; the NereusSDR panadapter already routes hover detail through `QToolTip` (spot labels, `SpectrumWidget.cpp:6405`). Same operator-visible content (frequency + width), one popup mechanism instead of two.
5. **Right-click on empty pan is left alone.** §7's table has an "Add notch at X MHz" convenience item from AetherSDR's general-area `QMenu`. NereusSDR's empty-pan right-click opens `SpectrumOverlayMenu`, a custom popup widget rather than a `QMenu`, so that row cannot be added without changing what a shipped gesture does. Not implemented here; see spec_gaps. Ctrl + right-click (the Thetis-authoritative gesture) and the `+TNF` button in Task 8 both cover adding.
6. **`notchMarkerById` is claimed by this task.** If Task 6 already added it for the colour helpers, reuse it and drop the duplicate declaration.

`src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h` ,  extend the public seam block added in Step 4 (before `int notchAtPixelForTest(int x) const;`):

```cpp

and after `int notchAtPixelForTest(int x) const;`:

```cpp

Append the file-scope helper immediately after the `configure` helper in the anonymous namespace of `tests/tst_notch_hit_test.cpp`:

```cpp

- [ ] **Step 23: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_hit_test && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_hit_test$' --output-on-failure`

    // Populate a caller-owned QMenu with the notch actions. Exists as a
    // seam because QMenu::exec() blocks, so the menu contents cannot be
    // asserted through a synthetic right-click.
    void buildNotchContextMenuForTest(int id, QMenu& menu) {
        buildNotchContextMenu(id, menu);
    }
```

`src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h` ,  extend the `signals:` block:

```cpp
    void notchActiveRequested(int id, bool active);
    void notchRemoveRequested(int id);
```

`src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h` ,  extend the private notch helper block:

```cpp
    void buildNotchContextMenu(int id, QMenu& menu);
```

`src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp` ,  append to the notch block:

```cpp
// Notch right-click menu. Contents from AetherSDR
// SpectrumWidget.cpp:8517-8572 [@c6481cbf], minus the Depth submenu and
// the Permanent toggle: WDSP's NBP has neither, so per design §1.2 the

void SpectrumWidget::buildNotchContextMenu(int id, QMenu& menu)
{
    const NotchMarker* n = notchMarkerById(id);
    if (!n) {
        return;
    }

    // Info header. AetherSDR renders it as a disabled QWidgetAction with a
    // two-line styled label (SpectrumWidget.cpp:8519-8546 [@c6481cbf]); a
    // disabled QAction carries the same text with no styling to maintain.
    QAction* info = menu.addAction(QString("%1 MHz    %2 Hz")

```

`src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp` ,  insert in the `Qt::RightButton` branch immediately after the Ctrl-add block added in Step 29, before the spot-label menu block:

```cpp
        // Right-click on a notch marker opens the notch menu. Thetis
        // suppresses every other right-click action while a notch is

        }
```

- [ ] **Step 35: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_hit_test && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_hit_test$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (32 tests).

### Task 8: +TNF button, status-bar indicator, menu action

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp`
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt` (append `longpath_add_test(tst_tnf_controls)` before the `get_property(_all_tests ...)` tail block)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.h:118-119` (signal gains `panId`), `src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.h:162` (button-index comment)
- Modify: `src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:223-229` (activate `+TNF`), `src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:272-278` (delete the disabled `MNF` twin)
- Modify: `src/models/NotchModel.h` (add `tnfAddCenterHz` beside `notchSidebandShift` in the public API block), `src/models/NotchModel.cpp`
- Modify: `src/gui/MainWindow.h:183-184` (three public statics), `src/gui/MainWindow.h:662-663` (`m_tnfAction`), `src/gui/MainWindow.h:72-79` (add `<QKeySequence>`)

- Test: `tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes (Task 3, `src/models/NotchModel.h`): `explicit NotchModel(QObject* parent = nullptr);` / `const QList<Notch>& notches() const;` / `bool globalEnabled() const;` / `void setGlobalEnabled(bool on);` / `int addNotch(double centerHz, double widthHz = 200.0);` / `static int notchSidebandShift(int filterLowHz, int filterHighHz);` / `void globalEnabledChanged(bool on);` / `void notchAdded(int id);` / `void notchRemoved(int id, int formerIndex);` / `void notchesReset();`
- Consumes (Task 4, `src/models/RadioModel.h`): `NotchModel* notchModel() const;`
- Consumes (existing): `double SliceModel::effectiveRxFrequency() const;` (`SliceModel.h:742`), `int SliceModel::filterLow() const;` (`:388`), `int SliceModel::filterHigh() const;` (`:391`), `SliceModel* MainWindow::sliceForPan(const QString& panId) const;` (`MainWindow.cpp:1784`), `void SpectrumOverlayPanel::setPanId(const QString& panId);` (`SpectrumOverlayPanel.h:69`), `constexpr auto NereusSDR::Style::kAccent` (`StyleConstants.h:44`)
- Produces: `void SpectrumOverlayPanel::addTnfClicked(const QString& panId);` (signal, arity changed from `()`), `static double NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz(double effectiveRxFrequencyHz, int filterLowHz, int filterHighHz);`, `static QString MainWindow::tnfIndicatorStyleSheet(bool globalEnabled);`, `static QString MainWindow::tnfIndicatorTooltip(int notchCount, bool globalEnabled);`, `static QKeySequence MainWindow::tnfToggleShortcut();`, `QAction* MainWindow::m_tnfAction` (private)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp`. Only the three overlay-panel slots are written now; Steps 7, 12 and 17 extend the same file.

```cpp
// =================================================================
// tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp  (NereusSDR)
// =================================================================
// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original test infrastructure. Nothing here
// is a port; the surfaces under test are fixed by
// docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md §7.5,
// §9 (overlay stub retirement) and §10.2 (shortcut scope).
//
// Build-order step 8: the three operator-facing TNF controls that live
// outside the panadapter itself.
//
//   1. The +TNF button on SpectrumOverlayPanel is live and carries the
//      id of the pan it is drawn on. The disabled "MNF" twin beside it
//      is gone -- §9: "Replace it rather than shipping both."
//   2. NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz composes the centre that button asks
//      for: VFO + RIT, shifted into the sideband (§7.5).
//   3. The status-bar TNF light's colour and tooltip are pure functions
//      of (notch count, global enable), and the DSP-menu accelerator is
//      a named constant (§10.2: no shortcut-assignment subsystem
//      exists, so the chord is fixed rather than registered).
//
// MainWindow needs a full RadioModel (WDSP, audio, network) to
// construct, which is too heavyweight for a unit-test executable -- see
// the header of tst_mainwindow_status_bar_safety.cpp. The three
// MainWindow surfaces under test are therefore public statics, callable
// without an instance, and the menu two-way sync is mirrored in test
// scope the way tst_applet_visibility_menu_wiring.cpp mirrors its
// menus.

QTEST_MAIN(TestTnfControls)
#include "tst_tnf_controls.moc"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the test**

Add to `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, immediately before the `get_property(_all_tests GLOBAL PROPERTY LONGPATH_ALL_TESTS)` tail block:

```cmake
# ── TNF build-order step 8: +TNF button, status-bar light, menu action ───────
# Verifies the three operator-facing TNF controls that live outside the
# panadapter:
#   - SpectrumOverlayPanel's +TNF button is enabled and carries its pan id;
#     the disabled "MNF" twin is gone (design §9).
#   - NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz composes VFO + RIT + sideband shift (§7.5).
#   - MainWindow's TNF indicator stylesheet / tooltip / accelerator statics
#     (§10.2 -- fixed chord, no shortcut-assignment subsystem exists).

longpath_add_test(tst_tnf_controls)
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tnf_controls && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tnf_controls$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL, 3 of 3 slots. `tnf_add_button_is_live` and `tnf_add_button_reports_its_own_pan` fail at `QVERIFY(btn)` with `'btn' returned FALSE` (the button has no `objectName` yet, so `findChild` returns null); `disabled_mnf_twin_is_gone` fails with `the disabled MNF stub must be replaced by +TNF, not shipped beside it`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Activate +TNF and delete the MNF stub**

`src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.h` -- replace lines 118-119:

```cpp
    /// Add a notch on the pan this strip belongs to. Carries the pan id for
    /// the same reason addRxClicked does: a control rendered on a pan acts on
    /// THAT pan, never on whichever pan is implicitly "active".
    ///
    /// Pure signal. The notch centre is composed by NotchModel and the add is
    /// issued by MainWindow, so no upstream-DSP logic lands in this file.
    void addTnfClicked(const QString& panId);
```

`src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.h` -- line 162 comment now counts seven strip buttons, not eight:

```cpp
    QVector<QPushButton*> m_menuBtns;   // indices 0-6 (buttons 2-8)
```

`src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp` -- replace lines 223-229:

```cpp
    // Button 3: +TNF
    {
        // From AetherSDR src/gui/SpectrumOverlayMenu.cpp:293 [@c6481cbf] --
        // the "+TNF" entry in the strip's button table. Upstream's signal is
        // arg-less; ours carries the pan id, matching the +RX shape at
        // SpectrumOverlayMenu.cpp:313 [@c6481cbf] so a strip drawn on pan-2
        // never adds a notch on pan-0.
        auto* btn = makeMenuBtn("+TNF", this);

        });
        m_menuBtns.append(btn);  // index 1
    }
```

`src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp` -- delete lines 272-278 outright (the blank line 272 plus the whole `// Button 9: MNF (NYI)` block). `makeDisabledBtn` stays in use by the ATT button at index 6, so it does not become unused.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tnf_controls && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tnf_controls$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (3 slots).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp tests/CMakeLists.txt \
        src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.h src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp
git commit -m "feat(tnf): activate the +TNF overlay button and retire the MNF stub"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 7: Extend the test for the +TNF centre composition**

Append these three slots to `TestTnfControls` in `tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp`, after `disabled_mnf_twin_is_gone()`:

```cpp
    // ── §7.5: +TNF centre = VFO + RIT, shifted into the sideband ──────────

    // USB F5 default passband is 100..3000 Hz, so notchSidebandShift returns
    // 100 + (2900 / 2) = 1550 and the notch lands mid-sideband, not on the
    // suppressed carrier.
    void tnf_add_centre_shifts_into_the_usb_sideband()
    {
        const double centre = NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz(14200000.0, 100, 3000);
        QCOMPARE(centre, 14200000.0 + 1550.0);
    }

    // LSB mirrors it: -3000..-100 puts the middle at -1550 Hz.
    void tnf_add_centre_shifts_into_the_lsb_sideband()
    {
        const double centre = NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz(7100000.0, -3000, -100);
        QCOMPARE(centre, 7100000.0 - 1550.0);
    }

    // The RIT term is the deliberate §7.5 divergence. Thetis scales RITValue
    // by 1e-6 onto a Hz quantity, which makes 100 Hz of RIT move the notch by
    // 0.0001 Hz -- a unit bug, not a behavioural choice. §4.1 puts RIT inside
    // the WDSP shift, so the demodulated RF already carries it and a notch at
    // bare VFO would sit rit_hz off the signal. SliceModel::effectiveRxFrequency
    // is the existing VFO+RIT accessor, so the caller feeds that in.
    void tnf_add_centre_carries_rit_because_the_shift_does()
    {
        SliceModel slice;
        slice.setFrequency(14200000.0);
        slice.setFilterLow(100);
        slice.setFilterHigh(3000);
        slice.setRitEnabled(true);
        slice.setRitHz(250);

        const double centre = NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz(
            slice.effectiveRxFrequency(), slice.filterLow(), slice.filterHigh());
        QCOMPARE(centre, 14200000.0 + 250.0 + 1550.0);
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tnf_controls && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tnf_controls$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile. `tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp: error: no member named 'tnfAddCenterHz' in 'NereusSDR::NotchModel'` (three occurrences). No test binary is produced.

- [ ] **Step 9: Add NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz**

`src/models/NotchModel.h` -- declare directly under the existing `notchSidebandShift` declaration in the public API block:

```cpp
    // The centre +TNF asks for. Static and slice-agnostic for the same reason
    // notchSidebandShift is: a global NotchModel (D1) cannot reach per-slice
    // filter edges or per-slice RIT, so the caller supplies both.
    //
    // From Thetis console.cs:40317-40330 [v2.10.3.15] -- TNFAdd(rx):
    //     vfoHz = VFOAFreq * 1.0e6;
    //     if (RITOn) vfoHz += (double)RITValue * 1e-6;   // check for RIT
    //     vfoHz += notchSidebandShift(rx);               //MW0LGE_21k9rc4
    //     AddNotch(vfoHz, rx);
    //
    // Deliberate divergence, design §7.5: upstream's `* 1e-6` scales an
    // already-Hz RITValue onto an already-Hz VFO, making the RIT term inert
    // (100 Hz of RIT moves the notch by 0.0001 Hz). We port the evident
    // intent, place the notch where the operator is listening, and fix the
    // unit by taking the RIT-inclusive frequency as the argument.
    // Flagged for maintainer review: reverting to upstream's effective
    // behaviour means passing the bare VFO instead.
    static double tnfAddCenterHz(double effectiveRxFrequencyHz,
                                 int filterLowHz, int filterHighHz);
```

`src/models/NotchModel.cpp` -- define immediately after `notchSidebandShift`:

```cpp
double NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz(double effectiveRxFrequencyHz,
                                  int filterLowHz, int filterHighHz)
{
    // From Thetis console.cs:40329 [v2.10.3.15]:
    //     vfoHz += notchSidebandShift(rx); //MW0LGE_21k9rc4
    return effectiveRxFrequencyHz
         + static_cast<double>(notchSidebandShift(filterLowHz, filterHighHz));
}
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tnf_controls && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tnf_controls$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (6 slots).

- [ ] **Step 11: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp src/models/NotchModel.h src/models/NotchModel.cpp
git commit -m "feat(tnf): compose the +TNF notch centre from VFO, RIT and sideband shift"
```

---

- [ ] **Step 12: Extend the test for the status-bar indicator**

Append these four slots to `TestTnfControls`, after `tnf_add_centre_carries_rit_because_the_shift_does()`:

```cpp
    // ── §7: the status-bar TNF light follows the global flag ──────────────

    void tnf_indicator_lights_accent_when_enabled()
    {
        const QString on = MainWindow::tnfIndicatorStyleSheet(true);
        QVERIFY2(on.contains(QLatin1String(Style::kAccent)), qPrintable(on));
        QVERIFY2(on.contains(QStringLiteral("font-size: 11px")), qPrintable(on));
    }

    // #404858 is the literal the CWX / DVK / FDX labels beside it already use
    // in buildStatusBar(), so the four stay a matched set when TNF is off.
    void tnf_indicator_dims_to_its_siblings_when_disabled()
    {
        const QString off = MainWindow::tnfIndicatorStyleSheet(false);
        QVERIFY2(off.contains(QStringLiteral("#404858")), qPrintable(off));
        QVERIFY2(!off.contains(QLatin1String(Style::kAccent)), qPrintable(off));
        QVERIFY2(off.contains(QStringLiteral("font-size: 11px")), qPrintable(off));
    }

    void tnf_tooltip_reports_an_empty_notch_list()
    {
        const QString tip = MainWindow::tnfIndicatorTooltip(0, false);
        QVERIFY2(tip.contains(QStringLiteral("no notches")), qPrintable(tip));
        QVERIFY2(tip.contains(QStringLiteral("Click to toggle")), qPrintable(tip));

    {
        const QString many = MainWindow::tnfIndicatorTooltip(3, true);
        QVERIFY2(many.contains(QStringLiteral("3 notches")), qPrintable(many));
        QVERIFY2(many.contains(QStringLiteral("enabled")), qPrintable(many));

        const QString one = MainWindow::tnfIndicatorTooltip(1, false);
        QVERIFY2(one.contains(QStringLiteral("1 notch,")), qPrintable(one));
        QVERIFY2(one.contains(QStringLiteral("bypassed")), qPrintable(one));
    }
```

`src/gui/MainWindow.h` -- add `#include <QKeySequence>` to the include block at lines 72-79 (after `#include <QActionGroup>`), and insert into the public section at line 184 (after `setVoltsAmpsVisible`):

```cpp
    // ── TNF status-bar light (design §7) ──────────────────────────────────

- [ ] **Step 18: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tnf_controls && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tnf_controls$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile. `tests/tst_tnf_controls.cpp: error: no member named 'tnfToggleShortcut' in 'NereusSDR::MainWindow'` (two occurrences).

- [ ] **Step 19: Ship the menu action, the accelerator and the +TNF handler**

`src/gui/MainWindow.h` -- add beside the other DSP menu actions at line 663 (after `m_binAction`):

```cpp
    QAction*      m_tnfAction = nullptr;
```

`src/gui/MainWindow.h` -- add to the public TNF block created in Step 14:

```cpp
    // The DSP > TNF accelerator. Public + static so the collision test can
    // read it without an instance; design §10.2 fixes it in code because
    // NereusSDR has no shortcut-assignment subsystem to register with.
    static QKeySequence tnfToggleShortcut();
```

`src/gui/MainWindow.cpp` -- define beside the other two statics, above `buildStatusBar()`:

```cpp
QKeySequence MainWindow::tnfToggleShortcut()
{
    // Design §10.2: KeyboardSetupPages.cpp:32-70 is a 100% NYI stub, no
    // ShortcutManager or registerAction exists in src/, and every shipped
    // shortcut is a plain QAction::setShortcut here. AetherSDR registers
    // "tnf_toggle" with an empty default sequence
    // (MainWindow_Shortcuts.cpp:1093 [@c6481cbf]) precisely because it HAS a
    // manager to bind it later; we ship a fixed chord instead. Building the
    // assignment subsystem is a separate epic and explicitly out of scope.
    return QKeySequence(Qt::CTRL | Qt::SHIFT | Qt::Key_N);
}
```

`src/gui/MainWindow.cpp` -- replace lines 5192-5197 in `buildMenuBar()`:

```cpp
    // TNF: enable or bypass every notch at once. Global rather than per-slice
    // because the notch list itself is global (design decision D1), which is
    // also how Thetis models it: TNFActive is a single flag despite the

        });
    }
```

`src/gui/MainWindow.cpp` -- insert in the per-pan overlay loop, after the `addRxClicked` connect that ends at line 1761:

```cpp
        // +TNF adds a notch on the slice THIS pan is showing, at the
        // frequency the operator is actually listening to.

        // arithmetic lives in NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz (design §7.5 and

        // console.cs:40315 is already enforced inside NotchModel::addNotch
        // (console.cs:40224), so the reject path is the model's.

```

- [ ] **Step 20: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_tnf_controls && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_tnf_controls$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (12 slots).

### Task 9: Fill in the existing MnfSetupPage

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h:245-251` (the `MnfSetupPage` class body) and `:90-93` (includes)
- Modify: `src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp:2103-2128` (the placeholder ctor block) and `:15-30` (includes)
- Modify: `src/core/WdspEngine.h:100-123` (test forward decls) and `:674-694` (friend list)
- Modify: `tests/CMakeLists.txt:2367` (append registration after `longpath_add_test(tst_cfc_setup_page)`)
- Test: `tests/tst_mnf_setup_page.cpp`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes (from Task 3, `src/models/NotchModel.h`):
  - `const QList<Notch>& NotchModel::notches() const`
  - `const Notch* NotchModel::notchById(int id) const`
  - `bool NotchModel::autoIncrease() const`
  - `int NotchModel::addNotch(double centerHz, double widthHz = 200.0)`
  - `bool NotchModel::setCenter(int id, double centerHz)`
  - `bool NotchModel::setWidth(int id, double widthHz)`
  - `bool NotchModel::setActive(int id, bool active)`
  - `bool NotchModel::removeNotch(int id)`
  - `void NotchModel::setAutoIncrease(bool on)`
  - `void NotchModel::setAdminBusy(bool busy)` / `bool NotchModel::adminBusy() const`
  - signals `notchAdded(int)`, `notchChanged(int)`, `notchRemoved(int,int)`, `notchesReset()`, `autoIncreaseChanged(bool)`
  - `Notch` fields `id` / `centerHz` / `widthHz` / `active` (design §5.1)
- Consumes (from Task 2, `src/core/RxChannel.h`): `double RxChannel::minNotchWidthHz() const`
- Consumes (from Task 4, `src/models/RadioModel.h`): `NotchModel* RadioModel::notchModel() const`
- Consumes (existing): `SliceModel* RadioModel::activeSlice() const` (`RadioModel.h:385`), `WdspEngine* RadioModel::wdspEngine()` (`RadioModel.h:233`), `RxChannel* WdspEngine::rxChannel(int) const` (`WdspEngine.h:238`), `WdspEngine::kFirstSliceChannelId` (`WdspEngine.h:211`), `double SliceModel::frequency() const` (`SliceModel.h:376`), `int SliceModel::sliceIndex() const` (`SliceModel.h:453`), `QHBoxLayout* SetupPage::addLabeledLabel(QLayout*, const QString&, QLabel*)` (`SetupPage.h:82`)
- Produces:
  - `MnfSetupPage::MnfSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr)` (signature unchanged; `SetupDialog.cpp:609` needs no edit)
  - `void MnfSetupPage::showEvent(QShowEvent* event) override`
  - private: `void rebuildTable()`, `void refreshRow(int notchId)`, `void commitRow(int notchId)`, `void beginAdminEdit()`, `void endAdminEdit()`, `void refreshMinNotchWidth()`
  - object names other code/tests can find: page-level `tblMNFNotches`, `btnMNFAdd`, `chkMNFAutoIncrease`, `lblMNFMinWidth`; per-row `udMNFFreq`, `udMNFWidth`, `chkMNFActive`, `btnMNFDelete`
  - `friend class ::TestMnfSetupPage;` on `WdspEngine` (Task 10 may reuse the seam)

#include "tst_mnf_setup_page.moc"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the test**

Append after `longpath_add_test(tst_cfc_setup_page)` (`tests/CMakeLists.txt:2367`):

```cmake
# ── TNF design §9 / build-order step 9: MnfSetupPage full implementation ─────
# Verifies Setup → DSP → MNF stops being a placeholder: the auto-increase
# checkbox, the notch table (one row per NotchModel entry, Thetis object names
# udMNFFreq / udMNFWidth / chkMNFActive / btnMNFDelete), the Add button seeding
# from the active slice's VFO, the adminBusy edit lock (Thetis
# SetupForm.NotchAdminBusy, console.cs:40009 [v2.10.3.15]) and the minimum
# notch width readout (RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth, nbp.c:594).
# Layout follows Thetis grpDSPMNF (setup.designer.cs:44145-44412 [v2.10.3.15]).

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_mnf_setup_page && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_mnf_setup_page$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL. `autoIncrease_controlExistsAndIsEnabled` reports `FAIL!  : TestMnfSetupPage::autoIncrease_controlExistsAndIsEnabled() 'chk' returned FALSE.` The placeholder builds a `QPushButton` labelled "Enable" with no object name, so `findChild<QCheckBox*>("chkMNFAutoIncrease")` is null. The three binding tests fail the same way.

- [ ] **Step 4: Replace the placeholder ctor with the group box plus auto-increase**

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h` ,  replace lines 245-251:

```cpp
// ── MNF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

class MnfSetupPage : public SetupPage {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MnfSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr);

private:
    QCheckBox* m_autoIncreaseChk{nullptr};
};
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  add to the include block (`:15-30`, alphabetical):

```cpp
#include "models/NotchModel.h"
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  replace lines 2103-2128:

```cpp

// caption (:44165, grpDSPMNF.Text = "Multi Notch Filter"); everything
// operator-facing outside Settings says TNF.
//
// grpDSPMNF's control set is at setup.designer.cs:44145-44159 [v2.10.3.15].

    m_autoIncreaseChk->setChecked(nm->autoIncrease());
    // From Thetis setup.designer.cs:44205 [v2.10.3.15] ,  chkMNFAutoIncrease tooltip.
    m_autoIncreaseChk->setToolTip(QStringLiteral(
        "The notch width will be increased if needed to ensure >100dB of attenuation"));
    mnfLay->addWidget(m_autoIncreaseChk);

    // Thetis fans the flag straight to three fixed channel ids from the Setup
    // form (setup.cs:17925-17932 [v2.10.3.15], chkMNFAutoIncrease_CheckedChanged
    // → WDSP.RXANBPSetAutoIncrease ×3). NereusSDR routes it through NotchModel
    // so RadioModel's fan-out reaches every open slice channel instead.
    connect(m_autoIncreaseChk, &QCheckBox::toggled, nm, &NotchModel::setAutoIncrease);
    connect(nm, &NotchModel::autoIncreaseChanged, m_autoIncreaseChk, [this](bool on) {
        QSignalBlocker b(m_autoIncreaseChk);
        m_autoIncreaseChk->setChecked(on);
    });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_mnf_setup_page && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_mnf_setup_page$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (5 slots).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp tests/tst_mnf_setup_page.cpp tests/CMakeLists.txt
git commit -m "feat(mnf): replace the MNF placeholder with a wired auto-increase control"

#### Cycle B: notch table and Add button

- [ ] **Step 7: Write the failing test**

Append these slots to `tests/tst_mnf_setup_page.cpp`, after `nullModel_doesNotCrash()`:

- [ ] **Step 8: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_mnf_setup_page && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_mnf_setup_page$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL. `table_hasOneRowPerNotch` reports `'table' returned FALSE` ,  there is no `tblMNFNotches` child yet. The other four new slots fail the same way on their `QVERIFY(table)` / `QVERIFY(add)`.

- [ ] **Step 9: Add the table, the Add button and the queued rebuild**

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h` ,  add the include (after `#include <QCheckBox>` at `:93`):

```cpp
#include <QList>
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h` ,  grow the `MnfSetupPage` body:

```cpp
class MnfSetupPage : public SetupPage {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MnfSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr);

private:
    // Full table rebuild. Wired to NotchModel's structural signals with
    // Qt::QueuedConnection so a rebuild never destroys the cell widget whose
    // signal is being emitted right now (the row Delete button above all).
    void rebuildTable();
    // Clear the Settings-side edit lock. NotchModel's mutators are shared with
    // the panadapter path and reject writes while adminBusy is set, so every
    // page-side write clears it first, exactly as Thetis's ENTER button does.
    void endAdminEdit();

    class QTableWidget* m_notchTable{nullptr};
    class QPushButton*  m_addBtn{nullptr};
    QCheckBox*          m_autoIncreaseChk{nullptr};

    // Table row → NotchModel notch id. The row lambdas capture the id, never
    // the row, so a reorder cannot mis-target a notch.
    QList<int> m_rowIds;
    bool m_rebuilding{false};
};
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  add to the include block:

```cpp
#include <QHeaderView>
#include <QTableWidget>
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  insert the range constants immediately above the `MnfSetupPage` ctor banner:

```cpp
// ── MNF editor ranges ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// which matches console.cs:13221 [v2.10.3.15] _max_filter_width = 10000.
static constexpr double kMnfWidthMaxHz = 10000.0;
// From Thetis setup.designer.cs:44323-44327 [v2.10.3.15] ,  udMNFWidth.Increment.
static constexpr double kMnfWidthStepHz = 1.0;
// Thetis's udMNFFreq is in MHz over 0..1000000 (setup.designer.cs:44360-44369
// [v2.10.3.15]); this column is in Hz, so the editor takes the bounds
// NotchModel constrains to: the pair VfoWidget.cpp:698 clamps to, whose ceiling
// is Thetis max_freq = 61.44 (console.cs:15552 [v2.10.3.15]).
static constexpr double kMnfCentreMinHz = 100000.0;
static constexpr double kMnfCentreMaxHz = 61440000.0;
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  in the ctor, insert the table and Add button between the `NotchModel* nm = model->notchModel();` line and the auto-increase block:

```cpp
    // ── Notch table ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    m_notchTable = new QTableWidget(0, 4, mnfGrp);
    m_notchTable->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("tblMNFNotches"));
    // Column captions follow Thetis lblMNFFreq / lblMNFWidth / chkMNFActive
    // (setup.designer.cs:44308, :44298, :44260 [v2.10.3.15]); the frequency
    // column is Hz here where upstream is MHz.
    m_notchTable->setHorizontalHeaderLabels({
        QStringLiteral("Center Frequency (Hz)"),
        QStringLiteral("Width (Hz)"),

        "QHeaderView::section { background: #1a2030; color: #8aa8c0; "
        "  border: 1px solid #304050; padding: 4px; }"));
    m_notchTable->setSelectionBehavior(QAbstractItemView::SelectRows);

    m_notchTable->setColumnWidth(1, 110);
    m_notchTable->setColumnWidth(2, 60);
    m_notchTable->setColumnWidth(3, 80);
    m_notchTable->verticalHeader()->setVisible(false);
    m_notchTable->setMinimumHeight(160);
    mnfLay->addWidget(m_notchTable);

    // ── Add ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    static const QString kMnfButtonStyle = QStringLiteral(
        "QPushButton { background: #203040; color: #c8d8e8; border: 1px solid #304050; "

        "QPushButton:hover { background: #2a4060; }"
        "QPushButton:pressed { background: #1a2840; }");

    m_addBtn = new QPushButton(QStringLiteral("Add"), mnfGrp);
    m_addBtn->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("btnMNFAdd"));
    // From Thetis setup.designer.cs:44286 [v2.10.3.15] ,  btnMNFAdd tooltip.
    m_addBtn->setToolTip(QStringLiteral("Add a notch"));
    m_addBtn->setStyleSheet(kMnfButtonStyle);

    auto* addRow = new QHBoxLayout;
    addRow->setContentsMargins(0, 0, 0, 0);
    addRow->setSpacing(8);
    addRow->addWidget(m_addBtn);
    addRow->addStretch();
    mnfLay->addLayout(addRow);

    connect(m_addBtn, &QPushButton::clicked, this, [this] {
        RadioModel* rm = model();
        if (!rm || !rm->notchModel()) { return; }
        SliceModel* slice = rm->activeSlice();
        if (!slice) { return; }
        // Thetis splits this into two clicks: btnMNFAdd opens an empty row and
        // btnVFOFreq fills it from VFOA ("Enter the Frequency from VFOA",

        // table edits in place.
        endAdminEdit();
        rm->notchModel()->addNotch(slice->frequency());
    });
```

and append the table wiring plus the first rebuild at the end of the ctor, after the auto-increase connects:

```cpp
    // ── Wiring: notch list ↔ table ───────────────────────────────────────────
    // Structural changes go through a queued rebuild; a direct connection would
    // let removeNotch() delete the row Delete button from inside that button's

    connect(nm, &NotchModel::notchAdded, this,
            [this](int) { rebuildTable(); }, Qt::QueuedConnection);
    connect(nm, &NotchModel::notchRemoved, this,

    connect(nm, &NotchModel::notchesReset, this,
            &MnfSetupPage::rebuildTable, Qt::QueuedConnection);

    rebuildTable();

- [ ] **Step 13: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_mnf_setup_page && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_mnf_setup_page$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL. `rowFrequencyEdit_commitsToModel` reports `Compared floats are not the same (fuzzy compare) Actual (n->centerHz): 1.42e+07  Expected (14200500.0): 1.42005e+07` ,  the row spin boxes have no connects yet. `rowActiveCheckbox_commitsToModel`, `rowEdit_holdsAdminBusy` (`adminBusy()` still false) and `rowValueChangedFromElsewhere_refreshesEditors` fail the same way.

- [ ] **Step 14: Wire the row editors, the commit path and the edit lock**

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h` ,  add to `MnfSetupPage`'s private section, above `endAdminEdit()`:

```cpp
    // Value-only refresh of one row. Destroys nothing, so it is safe to run
    // synchronously from inside a cell widget's own signal.
    void refreshRow(int notchId);
    void commitRow(int notchId);
    // Open the Settings-side edit window. Thetis's SetupForm.NotchAdminBusy is
    // AddActive | EditActive (setup.cs:17728-17734 [v2.10.3.15]); an in-place
    // table edit is the same window, opening on the first value change.
    void beginAdminEdit();
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  in `rebuildTable()`, add the connects after each editor's `setToolTip` and before its `setCellWidget` (values are pushed before the connect, so construction cannot look like an edit):

```cpp
        connect(freqSpin, &QDoubleSpinBox::valueChanged, this,
                [this](double) { beginAdminEdit(); });
        connect(freqSpin, &QDoubleSpinBox::editingFinished, this,
                [this, id] { commitRow(id); });
```

```cpp
        connect(widthSpin, &QDoubleSpinBox::valueChanged, this,
                [this](double) { beginAdminEdit(); });
        connect(widthSpin, &QDoubleSpinBox::editingFinished, this,
                [this, id] { commitRow(id); });
```

```cpp
        connect(activeChk, &QCheckBox::toggled, this, [this, id](bool on) {
            if (m_rebuilding) { return; }
            RadioModel* r = model();
            if (!r || !r->notchModel()) { return; }
            endAdminEdit();
            r->notchModel()->setActive(id, on);
        });
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  in the ctor, add the value-change connection alongside the three structural ones:

```cpp
    // Value-only changes refresh the row in place. Direct, not queued: it
    // rewrites the existing editors instead of replacing them, so it is safe
    // even when it lands inside a spin box's own editingFinished.
    connect(nm, &NotchModel::notchChanged, this, &MnfSetupPage::refreshRow);
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  new member functions after `rebuildTable()`:

    endAdminEdit();

    NotchModel* nm = rm->notchModel();
    nm->setCenter(notchId, freqSpin->value());
    nm->setWidth(notchId, widthSpin->value());
}

    rm->notchModel()->setAdminBusy(true);

#### Cycle D: minimum notch width readout

- [ ] **Step 17: Write the failing test**

Append these slots to `tests/tst_mnf_setup_page.cpp`:

```cpp
    // ── E. Minimum notch width ───────────────────────────────────────────────

    void minWidthLabel_showsPlaceholderWithoutAChannel()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        MnfSetupPage page(&model);

        QVERIFY(ch);

        MnfSetupPage page(&model);

        auto* lbl = page.findChild<QLabel*>(QStringLiteral("lblMNFMinWidth"));
        QVERIFY(lbl);
        QCOMPARE(lbl->text(),

        page.hide();
        page.show();
        QCOMPARE(lbl->text(), QStringLiteral("--"));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 18: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_mnf_setup_page && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_mnf_setup_page$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time first: `error: 'm_initialized' is a private member of 'NereusSDR::WdspEngine'`. After the friend seam lands, the run fails with `'lbl' returned FALSE` in `minWidthLabel_showsPlaceholderWithoutAChannel` ,  there is no `lblMNFMinWidth` child yet.

- [ ] **Step 19: Add the friend seam, the readout and the show-time refresh**

`src/core/WdspEngine.h` ,  append inside the `#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` forward-declaration block (after `class TestWdspChannelIdMap;`, `:122`):

```cpp
// TNF step 9: the MNF Settings page test primes the engine so it can open one
// real RX channel and check the minimum-notch-width readout against it.
class TestMnfSetupPage;
```

`src/core/WdspEngine.h` ,  append inside the class's `#ifdef LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` friend block (after `friend class ::TestWdspChannelIdMap;`, `:694`):

```cpp
    // TNF step 9: same friendship for the MnfSetupPage readout test.
    friend class ::TestMnfSetupPage;
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h` ,  add to `MnfSetupPage`:

```cpp
protected:
    void showEvent(QShowEvent* event) override;
```

and, in the private section:

```cpp
    void refreshMinNotchWidth();
```

plus the member, after `m_autoIncreaseChk`:

```cpp
    QLabel* m_minWidthLbl{nullptr};
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  add to the include block:

```cpp
#include "core/RxChannel.h"
#include <QShowEvent>
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  in the ctor, insert the readout between the Add-button block and the auto-increase block:

```cpp
    // ── Minimum notch width ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // Narrowest notch the current bandpass can realise: WDSP min_notch_width
    // (nbp.c:85-96), read through RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth (nbp.c:594). NereusSDR
    // -original control; Thetis pushes the same value out of
    // UpdateMinimumNotchWidthRX (console.cs:48787-48818 [v2.10.3.15]) to its
    // notch popup rather than to the Setup tab.
    m_minWidthLbl = new QLabel(QStringLiteral("--"), mnfGrp);
    m_minWidthLbl->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("lblMNFMinWidth"));
    m_minWidthLbl->setToolTip(QStringLiteral(
        "Narrowest notch the current bandpass filter can realise"));
    addLabeledLabel(mnfLay, QStringLiteral("Minimum Notch Width"), m_minWidthLbl);
```

and add the first read at the very end of the ctor, after `rebuildTable();`:

```cpp
    refreshMinNotchWidth();
```

`src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp` ,  new member functions after `beginAdminEdit()`:

```cpp
// ── MnfSetupPage::refreshMinNotchWidth ────────────────────────────────────────

void MnfSetupPage::refreshMinNotchWidth()
{
    if (!m_minWidthLbl) { return; }

    RadioModel* rm = model();
    WdspEngine* engine = rm ? rm->wdspEngine() : nullptr;
    if (!engine) {
        m_minWidthLbl->setText(QStringLiteral("--"));
        return;
    }

    // Thetis surfaces this per-RX (console.cs:48787-48818,
    // UpdateMinimumNotchWidthRX [v2.10.3.15]). NereusSDR's notch list is
    // global, so the readout follows the active slice's channel and falls back
    // to the first pooled channel before any slice exists.
    const int channelId = rm->activeSlice() ? rm->activeSlice()->sliceIndex()
                                            : WdspEngine::kFirstSliceChannelId;
    RxChannel* ch = engine->rxChannel(channelId);
    if (!ch) {
        m_minWidthLbl->setText(QStringLiteral("--"));
        return;
    }

    m_minWidthLbl->setText(
        QStringLiteral("%1 Hz").arg(ch->minNotchWidthHz(), 0, 'f', 1));
}

// ── MnfSetupPage::showEvent ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

void MnfSetupPage::showEvent(QShowEvent* event)
{
    SetupPage::showEvent(event);
    // min_notch_width varies with the bandpass coefficient count and the DSP
    // sample rate (nbp.c:85-96), both operator-changeable from the DSP Options
    // page, and nothing in the tree signals the change. Re-read on every visit.
    refreshMinNotchWidth();
    rebuildTable();
}
```

- [ ] **Step 20: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_mnf_setup_page && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_mnf_setup_page$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (22 slots).

## Cycle A: the `NotchVisualEnabled` model property

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin.cpp` with the header, the fixture helpers, and the three model slots. Later cycles append slots to this same file.

```cpp
// =================================================================
// tests/tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin.cpp
// =================================================================
// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original test infrastructure. Upstream file
// and line references in the comments below are context for a reviewer;
// the ported logic itself lives in src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp and
// src/models/NotchModel.cpp, each of which carries its own verbatim
// upstream header and PROVENANCE row.
//
// TNF Task 10. Design:
//   docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tunable-notch-filter-design.md
//   section 8.3 ("Visual notch (trace dent)") and section 11.
//
// The invariant under test, asserted in BOTH directions:
//
//   * processNoiseFloor() and peakDbmInSlicePassband() read a pristine,
//     UNDENTED copy of the spectrum pixels. A display preference must
//     not silently move the noise-floor estimate or the analog S-Meter's
//     MaxBin reading. That is the NereusSDR-only hazard section 8.3
//     names: Thetis reads MaxBin from WDSP upstream of its display code,
//     so a Thetis visual notch structurally cannot move its meter, and
//     ours would.
//
//   * ActivePeakHoldTrace and PeakBlobDetector DO see the dent. That is
//     Thetis-faithful (its spectral peak hold and blob detector both
//     read the dented array, display.cs:5269 / :5280 / :5337), and it is
//     asserted positively so a later reviewer does not "fix" it into a
//     divergence.
//
// Fixture geometry, chosen so every pixel index below is exact:
//   pan centre 14.200000 MHz, span 800 Hz across 800 display pixels
//     => 1.0 Hz per display pixel,
//   tone + notch at 14.200150 MHz => display pixel 550,
//   4096 synthetic FFT bins => 5.12 bins per pixel, tone in bin 2816.
//
// =================================================================
// Modification history (NereusSDR):
//   2026-07-29  J.J. Boyd / KG4VCF  TNF Task 10. Original test for

Register it. Insert into `tests/CMakeLists.txt` immediately after the `longpath_add_test(tst_diversity_dialog_persistence)` line (currently `:5732`), before the `Aggregate "all_tests" target` banner:

# Also covers the dent geometry (20 Hz fudge, WDSP minimum-width clamp),

longpath_add_test(tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time. `error: no member named 'visualEnabled' in 'NereusSDR::NotchModel'`, `no member named 'setVisualEnabled'`, and `no member named 'visualEnabledChanged'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the `visualEnabled` property to `NotchModel`**

In `src/models/NotchModel.h`, next to the `globalEnabled()` / `autoIncrease()` accessors:

```cpp
    // Section 8.3 visual-notch (trace dent) toggle. It lives on the model
    // rather than on SpectrumWidget because section 5.5 keys it alongside
    // the rest of the notch state, and because a multi-pan layout has one
    // widget per pan but one notch list; MainWindow pushes this value at
    // every pan. Default off; see section 8.3 for the upstream default and
    // its cite (the panadapter-side member in SpectrumWidget carries it).
    bool visualEnabled() const { return m_visualEnabled; }
    void setVisualEnabled(bool on);
```

In the `signals:` block:

```cpp
    void visualEnabledChanged(bool on);
```

In the private members, beside `m_globalEnabled` / `m_autoIncrease`:

```cpp
    bool m_visualEnabled{false};
```

In `src/models/NotchModel.cpp`, beside `setGlobalEnabled`:

```cpp
// Mirrors setGlobalEnabled: value-equality guard, then one signal. The fan-out
// is MainWindow's (per-pan), not a WDSP write: the visual notch is a display
// approximation and touches no DSP state.
void NotchModel::setVisualEnabled(bool on)
{
    if (m_visualEnabled == on) { return; }
    m_visualEnabled = on;
    emit visualEnabledChanged(on);
}
```

In `NotchModel::saveToSettings()`, with the other flat keys:

```cpp
    s.setValue(QStringLiteral("NotchVisualEnabled"), boolStr(m_visualEnabled));
```

In `NotchModel::restoreFromSettings()`, contains-guarded like every sibling key so a missing key leaves the in-memory default alone, and routed through the public setter so the signal fires:

```cpp
    if (s.contains(QStringLiteral("NotchVisualEnabled"))) {
        setVisualEnabled(
            s.value(QStringLiteral("NotchVisualEnabled")).toString()
            == QLatin1String("True"));
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (3 slots).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/models/NotchModel.h src/models/NotchModel.cpp \
        tests/tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin.cpp \

- [ ] **Step 17: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL at compile time first. `error: no member named 'activePeakHoldPeaksForTest'`, `no member named 'peakBlobsForTest'`. After those seams land, `noise_floor_estimate_reads_the_undented_copy()` and `max_bin_passband_peak_reads_the_undented_copy()` both fail their `QCOMPARE`, because both consumers still scan `m_renderedPixels`.

- [ ] **Step 18: Add the two seams and route the measurement consumers**

In `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h`, beside the seams added in Step 8:

```cpp
    const QVector<float>& activePeakHoldPeaksForTest() const {
        return m_activePeakHold.peaks();
    }
    const QVector<PeakBlob>& peakBlobsForTest() const {
        return m_peakBlobs.blobs();
    }
```

In `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp`, `processNoiseFloor()` (`:1850-1871`) reads the pristine copy. Replace the head of the function body:

```cpp
void SpectrumWidget::processNoiseFloor()
{
    // The noise floor is a MEASUREMENT, so it reads the undented pixels.
    // Upstream does the same: its accumulator takes max_copy from the
    // pristine array while everything else in that loop takes the dented
    // max ,  display.cs:5256-5259 [v2.10.3.15].
    const QVector<float>& src = measurementPixels();
    const int width = src.size();
    if (width <= 0) { return; }
```

and the accumulator loop:

```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < width; ++i) {
        const float dB = src[i];
        if (dB < currentAverage) {
            averageSum += std::pow(10.0, static_cast<double>(dB) / 10.0);
            averageCount++;
        }
    }
```

In `peakDbmInSlicePassband()` (`:2909-2938`), replace the two `m_renderedPixels` reads with the pristine copy. Head:

```cpp
double SpectrumWidget::peakDbmInSlicePassband() const
{
    // Deliberate NereusSDR-specific divergence from the dent-in-place rule
    // (design section 8.3, decision recorded 2026-07-28): this feeds
    // WdspEngine's MaxBin detector and therefore the analog S-Meter. Thetis
    // reads MaxBin from WDSP upstream of its display code, so its visual
    // notch structurally cannot move its meter; ours would if this scanned
    // the dented array. A display preference must not change a measurement.
    const QVector<float>& src = measurementPixels();
    const int n = src.size();
    if (n < 2 || m_bandwidthHz <= 0.0) { return -400.0; }
```

and the scan:

```cpp
    float peak = -400.0f;
    for (int i = firstPx; i <= lastPx; ++i) {
        if (src[i] > peak) { peak = src[i]; }
    }
    return static_cast<double>(peak);
```

Also update the doc comment on `peakDbmInSlicePassband` in `SpectrumWidget.h:397-413`, replacing "computed from `m_renderedPixels`" with "computed from the undented spectrum pixels (`measurementPixels()`); see the visual-notch note in the definition", so the header does not contradict the body.

- [ ] **Step 19: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

- [ ] **Step 22: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS for all four. `visualNotchWillDent()` already carries all three gates and `updateSpectrumLinear` already clears `m_undentedPixels`. If any of the four fails, the gate it names was dropped in Step 8 or Step 13; restore it before continuing.

- [ ] **Step 23: No implementation change; re-read the gate for drift**

Confirm `SpectrumWidget::visualNotchWillDent()` still reads exactly:

```cpp
    return m_visualNotchEnabled
        && !m_moxOverlay
        && m_notchGlobalEnabled
        && !m_notchMarkers.isEmpty();
```

and that the per-notch `if (!nc.active) { continue; } // skip inactive` is still the first statement of the loop body in `applyVisualNotchDent`. These four slots exist to pin that shape against later edits; the cycle is a characterisation cycle by design.

- [ ] **Step 24: Run the full spectrum-label subset for regressions**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tests_gui && ctest --test-dir build -L gui --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS, including `tst_nf_aware_grid`, `tst_clarity_nf_grid_coexistence`, `tst_spectrum_pipeline_modes` and `tst_waterfall_defaults_changes` (section 11 requires the first two to still pass with the visual notch present; they are a general regression check, not a guard on the section 8.3 invariant).

- [ ] **Step 25: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin.cpp
git commit -m "test(notch): pin the MOX, master-off and per-notch dent gates"
```

## Cycle F: the operator-facing toggle

- [ ] **Step 26: Write the failing test**

Append to the test file:

```cpp
    // ── Cycle F: the Settings control ────────────────────────────────────

    void mnf_page_visual_notch_checkbox_binds_both_ways()
    {
        RadioModel model;
        MnfSetupPage page(&model);
        page.show();

        auto* chk = page.findChild<QCheckBox*>(QStringLiteral("chkVisualNotch"));
        QVERIFY2(chk, "MnfSetupPage is missing chkVisualNotch");
        QVERIFY(model.notchModel());
        QCOMPARE(chk->isChecked(), false);

        // Widget -> model.
        chk->setChecked(true);
        QCOMPARE(model.notchModel()->visualEnabled(), true);

        // Model -> widget, without an echo loop.
        QSignalSpy spy(model.notchModel(), &NotchModel::visualEnabledChanged);
        model.notchModel()->setVisualEnabled(false);
        QCOMPARE(chk->isChecked(), false);
        QCOMPARE(spy.count(), 1);
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 27: Run it and watch it fail**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: FAIL. `'MnfSetupPage is missing chkVisualNotch' returned FALSE` at the `QVERIFY2`.

- [ ] **Step 28: Add `chkVisualNotch` to the MNF page and the per-pan fan-out**

In `src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h`, give `MnfSetupPage` a private member block (the class currently has none):

```cpp
class MnfSetupPage : public SetupPage {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MnfSetupPage(RadioModel* model, QWidget* parent = nullptr);

private:
    // ── Manual Notch group ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    QCheckBox* m_visualNotchChk{nullptr};
};
```

In `src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp`, at the tail of the `MnfSetupPage` ctor's Manual Notch group (`mnfLay` in scope), after the auto-increase and min-width controls Task 9 added:

```cpp
    // From Thetis setup.designer.cs:44167-44179 [v2.10.3.15] ,  chkVisualNotch,
    // the last control in grpDSPMNF. Caption and tooltip copied verbatim.
    NotchModel* notch = model->notchModel();
    if (notch) {
        m_visualNotchChk = new QCheckBox(
            "Visual approximation of notch (NOTE: this is not 100% "
            "representation of the active notch)");
        m_visualNotchChk->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("chkVisualNotch"));
        m_visualNotchChk->setWordWrap(true);
        // From Thetis setup.designer.cs:44177 [v2.10.3.15] ,  the tooltip.
        m_visualNotchChk->setToolTip(QStringLiteral(
            "This is a simple approximation and does not accurately "
            "represent the notch"));
        m_visualNotchChk->setChecked(notch->visualEnabled());
        mnfLay->addWidget(m_visualNotchChk);

        // From Thetis setup.cs:24376-24380 [v2.10.3.15]
        // chkVisualNotch_CheckedChanged sets Display.ShowVisualNotch AND
        // MiniSpec.ShowVisualNotch. NereusSDR has no mini-spectrum surface,
        // so only the panadapter half is ported.
        connect(m_visualNotchChk, &QCheckBox::toggled,
                notch, &NotchModel::setVisualEnabled);
        connect(notch, &NotchModel::visualEnabledChanged,
                m_visualNotchChk, [this](bool on) {
            QSignalBlocker b(m_visualNotchChk);
            m_visualNotchChk->setChecked(on);
        });
    }
```

Add `#include <QCheckBox>` to `src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h` if the header does not already carry it (the CFC page's members need it, so it normally does), and `#include "models/NotchModel.h"` to `src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp`.

In `src/gui/MainWindow.h`, immediately after `void refreshPanWideBadges();` (`:373`):

```cpp
    /// Design section 8.3: push the visual-notch (trace dent) toggle at every
    /// pan.
    ///
    /// Same shape as refreshPanWideBadges above, and for the same reason: the
    /// notch list is global but each pan converts it into its own pixel
    /// space, so the toggle has to reach pans created after startup too.
    /// Armed from PanadapterStack::countChanged.
    void refreshPanVisualNotch();
```

In `src/gui/MainWindow.cpp`, immediately after `refreshPanWideBadges()`'s closing brace (`:1478`):

```cpp
// Design section 8.3 visual-notch fan-out. See the declaration for why every
// pan is refreshed on every pass.
void MainWindow::refreshPanVisualNotch()
{
    if (!m_panStack || !m_radioModel) { return; }
    NotchModel* notch = m_radioModel->notchModel();
    if (!notch) { return; }
    const bool on = notch->visualEnabled();
    for (auto* applet : m_panStack->allApplets()) {
        if (!applet) { continue; }
        if (SpectrumWidget* sw = applet->spectrumWidget()) {
            sw->setVisualNotchEnabled(on);
        }
    }
}
```

In the `PanadapterStack::countChanged` handler (`:2168-2173`), add the call so a pan created by a layout switch inherits the toggle:

```cpp
    connect(m_panStack, &PanadapterStack::countChanged, this, [this](int) {
        wirePanStatusOverlayTriggers();
        wirePanBadgeHandlers();
        ensureOverlayPanels();
        refreshPanStatusOverlays();
        refreshPanVisualNotch();
    });
```

And immediately after the `m_panStack->restoreSplitterState();` block (`:2202`), arm the model trigger plus the startup push:

```cpp
    // Design section 8.3: the visual-notch toggle is model state, so it has a
    // model trigger as well as the pan-count one above. Seeded once here for
    // the pans that exist at startup, since NotchModel::restoreFromSettings
    // runs in the RadioModel constructor, long before any pan does.
    if (NotchModel* notch = m_radioModel->notchModel()) {
        connect(notch, &NotchModel::visualEnabledChanged, this,
                [this](bool) { refreshPanVisualNotch(); });
    }
    refreshPanVisualNotch();
```

Per-pan fan-out has no unit-test harness in-tree: `tests/tst_mainwindow_tools_spot_hub.cpp:5-10` records the established practice of testing MainWindow logic without constructing MainWindow. It is covered by bench matrix rows 12 and 13 in `docs/architecture/2026-07-28-tnf-verification/README.md` (Task 11).

Finally, retire the third stub named in section 9: in `src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:272-278`, Task 8 already replaced the disabled `"MNF"` button with the live `+TNF` button, so nothing further is owed here. Confirm that block no longer reads `makeDisabledBtn("MNF", this)` before committing.

- [ ] **Step 29: Run the test, watch it pass**

Run: `cmake --build build --target tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin$' --output-on-failure`

Expected: PASS (18 slots).

- [ ] **Step 30: Commit**

```bash
git add src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.h src/gui/setup/DspSetupPages.cpp \
        src/gui/MainWindow.h src/gui/MainWindow.cpp \
        tests/tst_notch_visual_does_not_perturb_noise_floor_or_maxbin.cpp
git commit -m "feat(notch): chkVisualNotch on the MNF page plus per-pan fan-out"

# Appendix: reconcile pass, full output

# Cross-task contract check: tunable notch filter (tasks 1-10)

Verified against the tree where a claim was checkable (`third_party/wdsp/src/RXA.c`, `src/gui/SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp`, `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.h/.cpp`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt`).

## 1. INTERFACE MISMATCHES

| # | Mismatch | Correction | Task to change |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Task 6 consumes `NotchModel::kNotchDefaultWidthHz` / `kNotchNarrowWidthHz`. Task 3 produces `kDefaultNotchWidthHz` / `kNarrowNotchWidthHz`. | Task 6 uses `NotchModel::kDefaultNotchWidthHz` and `NotchModel::kNarrowNotchWidthHz`. Task 3's names are already referenced by its own default argument (`widthHz = kDefaultNotchWidthHz`), so Task 3 must not rename. | **6** |
| 2 | `RxChannel::m_notchAutoIncrease` default: Task 2 `{true}`, Task 4 `{false}`. | Keep `{true}`. Verified `third_party/wdsp/src/RXA.c:105` passes `1, // auto-increase notch width` into `create_nbp`. A `{false}` carry plus Task 4's unconditional reconcile would silently disable auto-increase on every channel (bench row 8). Task 4 deletes its declaration entirely (see 4.1). | **4** |
| 3 | Task 4 cites `RXA.c:103` for `create_nbp autoincr = 1`. Actual line is `:105` (`:103` is inside the same call but is not that argument). Task 4 also cites `RXA.c:86` for master run; the value line is `:87` (`:86` is the `create_notchdb(` call). Task 2 and Task 3 both cite `:87` / `:105` correctly. | Task 4 uses `RXA.c:87` and `RXA.c:105`. | **4** |
| 4 | Same executable `tst_notch_hit_test` declared with different labels: Task 6 says `gui` + `models`, Task 7 says `gui` + `core`. | Labels are auto-derived by `_longpath_derive_test_labels()` (`tests/CMakeLists.txt:186`), so both manual claims are advisory. The real defect is double registration; see 4.3. Drop the label claim from Task 7. | **7** |
| 5 | Task 8 states `m_menuBtns` is "now 7 entries, indices 0-6" without saying what was removed. Tree currently has 8 appends (`SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:220,228,236,244,255,263,270,277`), `+TNF` already at index 1 and the `MNF` disabled stub at index 7. | The arithmetic is correct only if Task 8 deletes the `MNF` stub at `SpectrumOverlayPanel.cpp:273-278` and keeps `+TNF` at index 1. Task 8 must say so explicitly, because Task 10 consumes that deletion. | **8** |
| 6 | Unit split: `SpectrumWidget::NotchMarker::freqMhz` is MHz (Task 6) while `NotchModel::centerHz`, all five `notch*Requested` signals, `setNotchMinWidthHz`, and Task 10's dent maths are Hz. | Not wrong, but undeclared as a conversion boundary. State in Task 6's contract that `MainWindow::refreshPanNotchMarkers` is the only Hz-to-MHz conversion site and that every signal out of `SpectrumWidget` is Hz. Tasks 7 and 10 both do `freqMhz * 1e6` arithmetic and will silently be off by 1e6 if either assumes otherwise. | **6** (declare), 7 and 10 (consume as declared) |

## 2. MISSING PRODUCERS

1. **Nobody calls `NotchModel::restoreFromSettings()` or `saveToSettings()`.** Task 3 produces both. Task 6 gap 8 *assumes* "`restoreFromSettings()` runs in the `RadioModel` constructor". Task 4 owns the ctor change (`std::unique_ptr<NotchModel> m_notchModel`) and its Produces list contains no restore call, and its gap 6 explicitly declines to add a save trigger on the assumption Task 3 wired save-on-mutate internally. Task 3's contract never says it does. Net result as written: notches never persist and never reload. Assign: Task 4 constructs and calls `restoreFromSettings()` in the ctor; Task 3 declares the save trigger (save-on-mutate inside `NotchModel`, or a named `RadioModel` hook). Task 10's visual-flag round-trip test depends on whichever is chosen.
2. **Nobody wires `RxChannel::minNotchWidthHz()` into `SpectrumWidget::setNotchMinWidthHz()`.** Task 6 produces the setter and defers the call site to "step 10"; Task 10 produces no such wiring; Task 9 reads `minNotchWidthHz()` only for the `lblMNFMinWidth` label. The widget therefore keeps its hardcoded `m_notchMinWidthHz{100.0}` forever, which feeds Task 7's edge-drag clamp and Task 10's `max(width, min)` dent span. Assign to Task 10 (it already touches both `SpectrumWidget` and `MainWindow`), or to Task 9 alongside the label refresh.
3. **Task 10 consumes the removal of `makeDisabledBtn("MNF", this)` from Task 8**, which Task 8 implies by a count but never declares. See 1.5.
4. **Task 10 consumes "the file-local `QString boolStr(bool v)` helper in `NotchModel.cpp`"**, which Task 3's Produces never mentions. Either Task 3 declares it, or Task 10 stops depending on another TU's file-local static (it is file-local, so Task 10 can only use it from inside `NotchModel.cpp`, which is fine, but the dependency must be declared).
5. **Task 8 registers no test executable.** Its Produces lists three statics, a `QAction` and object names, and its gaps describe an accelerator-collision test and a menu two-way-sync mirror test, but names no target and no `longpath_add_test` line. Add one (suggest `tst_tnf_ui_wiring`).
6. **Task 8's `+TNF` click handler is unnamed.** `SpectrumOverlayPanel::addTnfClicked(const QString&)` needs a `MainWindow` slot that resolves `sliceForPan(panId)` and calls `NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz` + `addNotch`. Task 6 produces `MainWindow::onNotchCreateRequested(double, bool)` for the panadapter gesture; Task 8 should either reuse it or name a distinct member.
7. **Unconsumed producers (inverse problem, likely dead code):** `NotchModel::notchAddRejected(QString)`, `notchNearFreq()`, `notchesInBandwidth()`, `notchSurrounding()` (all Task 3) have no consumer in tasks 4-10. Task 7 hit-tests in pixel space via its own `notchAtPixel`, and the dedupe rejection has no UI surface, so a `+TNF` press that lands inside the 10 Hz dedupe window is silently ignored. Either wire `notchAddRejected` to a status message in Task 8 or drop the signal and the three helpers.

## 3. ORDERING PROBLEMS

No task consumes anything produced by a higher-numbered task. Three **backward file edits** exist (legal but merge-conflict prone, and each needs the earlier task to leave room):

- Task 4 edits `RxChannel`'s carries created by Task 2 (resolve by deleting Task 4's copy, see 4.1).
- Task 8 adds `static double NotchModel::tnfAddCenterHz(...)` to Task 3's file.
- Task 10 adds `visualEnabled` / `setVisualEnabled` / `visualEnabledChanged` to Task 3's file (resolve by deleting Task 10's copy, see 4.4).
- Four separate tasks (1, 2, 4, 9) each add a forward decl plus a `friend class ::TestX;` line to the same two `LONGPATH_BUILD_TESTS` blocks in `src/core/WdspEngine.h:100-124` and `:674-695`. Expect textual conflicts; sequence them or land them as one combined edit.

## 4. DUPLICATED WORK

1. **`RxChannel::notchesRun()` / `notchAutoIncrease()` and both carries: Tasks 2 and 4.** Task 2 wins (it also picks the correct `{true}` default). Task 4 deletes them from its Produces and keeps only `notchAt(int, Notch&)`. Task 2 must additionally state that both carries are written **outside** `#ifdef HAVE_WDSP`, otherwise Task 4's gap-1 fixup ("moves the carry write above the guard") becomes a real edit again.
2. **`tst_notch_hit_test` registered by Task 6 and again by Task 7.** Two `add_executable()` calls with the same target name is a hard CMake configure error, not a style nit. Task 6 creates and registers the file; Task 7 appends slots only and registers nothing.
3. **The five `SpectrumWidget` notch signals and `m_selectedNotchId` / `m_hoveredNotchId`: Tasks 6 and 7 both list them as Produces.** Task 6 declares them (its `drawNotchMarkers` colour logic reads both ids); Task 7 moves them to Consumes and produces only `NotchGrab`, `m_notchGrab`, the drag-anchor members and the hit-test seams.
4. **`NotchModel::visualEnabled` / `setVisualEnabled` / `visualEnabledChanged` and the `NotchVisualEnabled` key: Tasks 3 and 10.** Task 3 wins (it already added them via its gap 2, with the same `false` default). Task 10's Cycle A collapses to Consumes; Task 10 keeps only `SpectrumWidget::setVisualNotchEnabled` and the `chkVisualNotch` binding.
5. **Bound constants triplicated.** Task 3 produces public `NotchModel::kMaxNotchWidthHz = 10000.0`, `kMinNotchCentreHz = 100000.0`, `kMaxNotchCentreHz = 61440000.0`. Task 9 re-declares `kMnfWidthMaxHz` / `kMnfCentreMinHz` / `kMnfCentreMaxHz` with identical values; Task 7 re-declares `kNotchMaxWidthHz = 10000.0`. Correction: Task 9 keeps only `kMnfWidthMinHz` (0.0) and `kMnfWidthStepHz` (1.0) and uses `NotchModel::` for the other three; Task 7 uses `NotchModel::kMaxNotchWidthHz`. `src/gui/SpectrumWidget.cpp:125` already includes `models/BandPlanManager.h`, so the gui-to-models include is established precedent and Task 7's page-local copy is unnecessary.
6. **Width clamping in two places.** Task 3 gap 5 puts the wheel edge-clamp and max-width clamp inside `NotchModel::setWidth` so Task 7's handler is a bare `setWidth(id, current + delta * step)`. Task 7 then clamps again against its own `kNotchMaxWidthHz` before emitting. Harmless but divergence-prone: drop the widget-side clamp, keep the model authoritative.
7. **Geometry computed twice.** Task 6's paint call sites pass a `specRect` computed in `paintEvent` / the GPU overlay rebuild; Task 7 introduces `notchSpecRect()` for hit testing. If they diverge, hit boxes miss drawn markers, and Task 6's `drawNotchMarkersForTest(QPainter&, QRect)` takes the rect as a parameter so no test catches it. Correction: Task 7's `notchSpecRect()` becomes the single source and Task 6's two paint sites call it.

## 5. SPEC GAPS TO ESCALATE (consolidated, deduped)

**Blocking, needs a maintainer decision:**

1. **Default values (CLAUDE.md puts these outside autonomous change).** Three defaults are unspecified by the spec and were each picked independently:
   - `NotchModel::globalEnabled` default. Task 3 chose `true` (AetherSDR `TnfModel.h:52`); Thetis `chkTNF` ships unchecked; WDSP `create_notchdb` master run is `0` (`RXA.c:87`). Task 6 hardcodes `m_notchGlobalEnabled{true}` in the widget to match. One decision, three files.
   - `NotchModel::autoIncrease` default. Not stated anywhere. Must be `true` (`RXA.c:105`) or Task 4's reconcile disables it on every channel. Confirm against `chkMNFAutoIncrease` in Thetis before Task 9 ships.
   - `visualEnabled` default `false`. Tasks 3 and 10 agree; cited to `setup.designer.cs:44167-44179` (no `Checked` assignment). Low risk, confirm only.
2. **Attribution scope of `NotchModel`.** §10.1 declares the new attribution event over exactly three upstream files (AetherSDR `TnfModel`, `radio.cs`, `console.cs`). Task 3 adds a `setup.designer.cs:44167-44179` cite for the visual-notch default; Task 8 adds `console.cs` maths (already covered); Task 10 explicitly *avoided* a `display.cs` cite on `NotchModel` for exactly this reason and moved it to `SpectrumWidget`. Under CLAUDE.md's multi-file rule, Task 3's `setup.designer.cs` cite obliges a fourth verbatim header. Decide: widen the attribution event to four files, or move that one cite to `DspSetupPages.cpp` (already `setup.cs`-registered).
3. **`adminBusy` is self-defeating as specified.** §9 has the MNF page hold `adminBusy` while editing; §5.4 has `NotchModel`'s mutators reject writes while `adminBusy` is set. The page and the panadapter share one mutator set, so the page cannot commit its own edit. Task 9 resolved it source-first (Thetis clears `AddActive` / `EditActive` before writing, `setup.cs:17738-17768`), which means the flag protects only the panadapter path during the edit window. Confirm that is the intent, or the flag should be dropped.
4. **`RXANBPGetMinNotchWidth` has no refresh trigger** (raised independently by Tasks 2, 6 and 9). Nothing signals a change to `nc` or the DSP rate; `SetupPage::syncFromModel()` has no call site in `src/`. Task 9 falls back to ctor plus a `showEvent()` override. Bench row 7 ("min-width readout changes when nc changes") depends on adding a `minNotchWidthChanged(double)` signal driven from `setFilterSizeSamples` / `setSampleRate`. Combine with missing-producer 2 above.

**UX or scope decisions taken by a task, not by the spec:**

5. Task 7 **drops** the §7 table's "right-click on empty pan -> Add notch at X MHz". NereusSDR's empty-pan right-click opens `SpectrumOverlayMenu`, a bespoke popup, not a `QMenu`; adding the item changes a shipped gesture. Ctrl + right-click covers the same capability. Restoring the item requires converting the empty-pan right-click to a `QMenu`.
6. Task 8 picks **Ctrl+Shift+N** for the TNF toggle (spec names no chord; AetherSDR passes an empty `QKeySequence`). Verified unclaimed.
7. Task 8 leaves `+TNF` **ungated on connection state** (AetherSDR gates it) on the grounds that D3 makes the notch list client-side operator state.
8. Task 9 **drops** the placeholder's "Window" combo: `grep comboMNFWindow` over Thetis v2.10.3.15 returns nothing and `grpDSPMNF` has no such control.
9. Task 6 **keeps** AetherSDR's `200`/`80` grab-handle alpha (double-encodes master-off alongside the Olive swap) and **omits** Thetis's centre notch line (`display.cs:8737`). Both are divergences a parity reviewer will notice.
10. Task 1 chose to **keep** `seedConnectFrequency` and push the hosting stream centre, out of §4.5's two mutually exclusive options ("pushes the stream's centre, **or** is dropped entirely"). Also: §4.4 says "two writers" of the shift; there are three (`activateSliceChannel` at `RadioModel.cpp:3144` runs at the tail of `bindSliceToStream`).
11. Task 5's edit to `tests/data/tci/matrix.csv` row `rx_nf_enable_set_rx0` is **mandatory, not optional**: the row pins the single-index notification that §6.4 orders removed, and `tst_tci_matrix_runner` asserts it. The generated verification README must be regenerated with it. Spec is silent.
12. Task 3 **did not port** `GetFirstNotchThatMatches` (`radio.cs:4246-4258`), listed in §5.3 with no signature and made redundant by stable ids. Combine with unconsumed-producer item 2.7 above when deciding the final `NotchModel` surface.

**Non-blocking observations:**

13. `struct Notch` placement is the one cross-task ambiguity that **did** resolve cleanly: Tasks 2 and 3 both land it in `src/core/dsp/Notch.h` (namespace `NereusSDR`), and Tasks 4, 6, 9 wrote themselves to be agnostic. No action beyond confirming Task 2 creates the file and its PROVENANCE row.
14. `scripts/gen-tci-matrix-readme.py:2` documents a stale output path (`docs/architecture/phase3j-tci-matrix/README.md`); the live file is `docs/architecture/2026-05-09-phase3j-1-tci-port-verification/README.md`. Out of scope for this epic; worth a chip.

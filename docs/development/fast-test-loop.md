# Fast Test Loop

The suite has **513 registered tests** (517 `tst_*.cpp` files; four are
Linux/PipeWire-only and register only on Linux).

Every test executable statically links the entire application, so each one
costs about **38 CPU-seconds to link** and lands at roughly 35 MB. Building
all of them costs about **32 minutes**, and running them cold adds about
5 more. Almost nothing you do day to day needs that.

## Everyday commands

Build and run one test:

```bash
cmake --build build --target tst_slice_auto_agc && ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_slice_auto_agc$' --output-on-failure
```

Run a subsystem. Labels are derived automatically at configure time from
each test's own `#include` lines, so they never need hand-maintenance:

```bash
cmake --build build --target tests_core && ctest --test-dir build -L core
```

**Always build the matching `tests_<label>` target first.** Test
executables are `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`, so a plain `cmake --build build` does
not rebuild them. Running `ctest -L core` on its own is unsafe: on a clean
tree every selected test reports "Not Run", and on an already-populated
tree it silently executes **stale binaries built from your previous code**
and returns a false green. There is one `tests_<label>` target per label,
generated from the same derivation that produces the labels, so the two
cannot drift apart.

Current distribution:

| Label | Tests |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | 423 |
| `models` | 191 |
| `gui` | 152 |
| `unclassified` | 5 |

Tests commonly touch more than one subsystem, so these do not sum to 513.
`unclassified` means the test includes no `core/`, `models/`, or `gui/`
header at all; the five current members are all legitimately in that
category (a smoke test, a WDSP `extern "C"` test, a build-hygiene grep
test, and two that deliberately avoid instantiating GUI classes).

Every test also carries `TIMEOUT 120`, so a hung test fails instead of
blocking forever.

### Labels narrow the run, not the dependency

Labels are derived from each test's **direct** includes, so they are a
triage aid, not a blast-radius calculation. **85 of the 513 tests carry no
`core` label but still statically link all of `NereusSDRObjs`**, so a
`src/core` edit genuinely affects them even though `ctest -L core` will not
run them.

Until the Phase 1 library split lands, every test depends on every source
file. Use `-L` to get fast feedback while iterating; use the full suite
before you call something done.

## Building tests is opt-in

Test executables are `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`, so a routine build only builds the
app. Measured after touching `src/core/AppSettings.cpp`:

```bash
cmake --build build        # 1.64 s, links 0 test binaries
```

Everything that runs tests must therefore name a target first:

```bash
cmake --build build --target tst_slice_auto_agc   # one test
cmake --build build --target tests_core           # one subsystem
cmake --build build --target all_tests            # the lot (~32 min cold)
```

Then run `ctest`. **Skipping the build step is the one real footgun here**:
`ctest` on its own will happily run whatever binaries are already on disk,
which after a source change means testing your previous code and getting a
green that means nothing.

## Two build directories, and what each one hides

`./build.sh` builds into `build/`. `./tools/run_tests.sh` builds into
`build-tests/`. **They are configured differently, and each one can pass
while the other is broken.**

| | `build/` | `build-tests/` |
|---|---|---|
| configured by | `./build.sh` | `./tools/run_tests.sh` |
| `NEREUS_BUILD_TESTS` | OFF (the shipping default) | ON |
| what it proves | the app compiles as shipped | the tests compile and pass |

`CMakeLists.txt:1691` propagates `NEREUS_BUILD_TESTS` to the
`NereusSDRObjs` object library, so the two directories hold **different
object code for the same sources**. Anything inside an
`#ifdef NEREUS_BUILD_TESTS` block exists in one and not in the other.

Two consequences, both of which have already bitten:

**A green suite does not mean the app builds.** On 2026-08-17 the app had
not been buildable from scratch since `49d10dc8`: `RadioModel::txWorker()`
sat inside the test-only guard while `TxVoiceCheckDialog.cpp` — production
code — called it five times. Every CI job configures with
`NEREUS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`, so the suite compiled it every time and reported
678 green. The `ship-build` job in `ci.yml` exists to close exactly this
gap; run it locally as a clean `rm -rf build && ./build.sh`.

**Running a test binary by hand from the wrong directory tests nothing.**
`build/tests/tst_foo` is whatever `build.sh` last happened to link there —
usually stale, sometimes ancient. The same afternoon, five tests "passed"
from `build/tests/` while failing in `build-tests/`, and chasing that
phantom cost hours. If you invoke a test binary directly, take it from
`build-tests/tests/`, and only after `run_tests.sh` has rebuilt it.

Related footgun, same shape: piping `./build.sh` into another command
throws its exit status away. `./build.sh | tail -6` reports the status of
`tail`, which is always 0. Use `./build.sh --quiet` when a script needs
the status.

## macOS: the first-run scan

macOS malware-scans every freshly linked binary the first time it runs.
With hundreds of new binaries this adds roughly 5 minutes to a cold suite
run, and it is why a test asserting `1 + 1 == 2` can take 6 seconds cold
and 0.1 seconds warm.

To exempt build-spawned processes, add your terminal under:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Tools**

Machine-local; changes nothing in the repository.

## ccache

Wired automatically when `ccache` is on `PATH`. Install it:

```bash
brew install ccache
```

It needs one non-default setting, because the build shares a precompiled
header across targets via `REUSE_FROM`:

```bash
ccache --set-config sloppiness=pch_defines,time_macros
```

Without that, PCH'd compiles are effectively uncacheable. Check
effectiveness with `ccache -s`.

## Writing tests that stay fast

**Never sleep to wait for a state change.** Wait on the signal instead.
`tst_reconnect_on_silence` used to call `QTest::qWait(35000)` and
`QTest::qWait(7000)` while waiting out a real reconnect timeline. At 53.5
seconds it was the slowest test in the suite, and because a parallel run
cannot finish before its slowest single test, it set a hard floor on the
whole suite no matter how many cores were available.

It now runs in **1.3 seconds** by injecting compressed timings and
asserting on a `QSignalSpy` transition count:

```cpp
QSignalSpy transitions(&conn, &P1RadioConnection::connectionStateChanged);
// ...
QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT(transitions.count() >= 7, 4000);
QCOMPARE(transitions.count(), 7);
```

`QTRY_*` returns the moment the condition holds, so the timeout is only an
upper bound. This is both faster and more robust under parallel load than a
fixed `qWait` computed against a hand-derived deadline.

If a timing constant makes a test slow, add a narrow test-only seam rather
than sleeping. Keep production defaults untouched, and make it obvious the
setter has no production callers.

## Where the settings file lives

Tests redirect Qt's writable locations into a sandbox via
`tests/TestSandboxInit.cpp`, which runs before `main()`. This exists
because a ctest run once overwrote a developer's real settings file
(v0.1.1 alpha).

The real file is **platform-specific**. CLAUDE.md quotes the Linux path;
on macOS it resolves elsewhere (see `src/core/AppSettings.cpp:112-118`):

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Preferences/NereusSDR/NereusSDR.settings` |
| Linux | `~/.config/NereusSDR/NereusSDR.settings` |

If you are verifying that a test did not touch it, check the right one. A
check against the wrong path silently "passes" while proving nothing.

## Why the suite is slow, structurally

Linking dominates: about 32 minutes of the 37 is the linker, not the tests.
The cause is that `NereusSDRObjs` is one all-or-nothing OBJECT library
spanning `core`, `models`, and `gui`, so every source file is a transitive
input to every test binary and the build graph cannot tell that a
`SpectrumWidget` edit is irrelevant to a protocol test.

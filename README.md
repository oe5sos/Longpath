NereusSDR is a C++20/Qt6 port of [Thetis](https://github.com/ramdor/Thetis) — the canonical OpenHPSDR / Apache Labs SDR console, itself descended from FlexRadio PowerSDR — carrying its radio logic, DSP integration, and feature set forward to a native cross-platform codebase (macOS, Linux, Windows) with a Qt-based GUI. The Thetis contributor lineage (FlexRadio Systems, Doug Wigley W5WC, Richard Samphire MW0LGE, and the wider OpenHPSDR community) is preserved per-file in source headers and summarized in [docs/attribution/THETIS-PROVENANCE.md](docs/attribution/THETIS-PROVENANCE.md). Distributed under GPLv3 (root [LICENSE](LICENSE)), elected under the "or later" grant in upstream Thetis source-file headers (Thetis is GPLv2-or-later). A verbatim copy of GPLv2 ships at [docs/attribution/LICENSE-GPLv2](docs/attribution/LICENSE-GPLv2) for reference, since several WDSP and ChannelMaster source files explicitly reference v2.

## Releases & Installation

Pre-built binaries for Linux (AppImage, x86_64 + aarch64), macOS (DMG +
PKG, Apple Silicon + Intel), and Windows (NSIS installer + portable ZIP,
x64) are published as GitHub Releases:

**<https://github.com/boydsoftprez/NereusSDR/releases>**

All artifacts are GPG-signed (`KG4VCF`) via `SHA256SUMS.txt.asc`. To verify:

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys KG4VCF
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.txt.asc SHA256SUMS.txt
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

> **Alpha builds:** until Apple Developer ID and Authenticode certificates
> are obtained, macOS users will need to right-click → Open the DMG on first
> launch, and Windows users will see a SmartScreen warning to click through.
> Linux is unaffected. See the per-release notes for details.
>
> **v0.4.0 status:** macOS DMG and PKG remain Apple Developer ID-signed and
> notarized; Gatekeeper accepts them on first launch. Windows installer
> remains unsigned (Authenticode certificate pending); SmartScreen "More
> info → Run anyway" still applies.

## Current Status

**Current release: v0.5.2** (2026-05-24). Substantial release on top of v0.5.1 (and v0.5.0 underneath). One major epic plus a new SKU port, a new UI subsystem, and a polish tail: **Phase 3P-II External RF accessories** (AetherSDR 1:1 PGXL + TGXL baseline, Thetis analog S-Meter port with 4 RX modes, connection robustness with exponential auto-reconnect / keepalive / RTT-correlated ping / full PGXL pairing flow, advanced UI with Fault Log / Tune Memory / TX Interlock Policy / power-cap toast); **ANAN-G2E (HermesC10) SKU port** (new board enum, hardware profile verified against Thetis v2.10.3.15, codec wrappers, BPF1 algorithm, PA telemetry, P2 RX unblock + crash fix); **Applet visibility controller** (hamburger menu on AppletPanel banner, View → Containers → Applets show/hide, capability-gated availability, persistence); **polish tail** (4O3A integration cleanup, TCI live-state fixes + 5 review issues, PS-A persistence, PA profile / quit handling). v0.5.2's 3P-II bench-verification matrix (36 rows) is pending live PGXL + TGXL hardware; the ANAN-G2E matrix (12 rows) is pending live G2E hardware. **v0.5.1** (2026-05-15) was the patch before: three ship-blocking release-artifact fixes (Windows `rade.dll`, macOS x86_64 `Qt6::WebSockets`, HL2 + Win11 waterfall slider persistence), three correctness fixes (orphan `.bak` recovery, connect-state-stuck-green, VOX prime-on-connect), and two CodeQL pipeline maintenance fixes. v0.5.0 detail below.

**Phase 3J-1: TCI v2.0 WebSocket server.** External programs (WSJT-X, JTDX, FreeDV, Quisk, ESDR3, N1MM, Log4OM, contest software) can now drive NereusSDR over Thetis-compatible TCI. Setup > CAT/Network > TCI Server configures bind interface, port, and sensor intervals; Tools > TCI Server opens the log viewer; the bottom-bar TCI indicator shows live state. The audio pipeline negotiates 8 / 12 / 16 / 44.1 / 48 kHz with per-stream resampling, so FreeDV 8 kHz, Quisk, and JTDX 12 kHz all work end-to-end. 15 closeout items shipped after the initial port stabilized the on-bench behaviour against real clients.

**Phase 3J-2: Spot system, FreeDV Reporter, PSK Reporter.** Seven spot-source clients in one place: DX cluster, RBN, WSJT-X UDP, SpotCollector / DXLab UDP, POTA HTTPS, FreeDV Reporter Socket.IO, PSK Reporter IPFIX. Tools > Spot Hub (Ctrl+Shift+S) opens a 10-tab modeless dialog; Tools > FreeDV Reporter (Ctrl+Shift+R) opens the 14-column live station view with TX/RX highlights, QSY support, and 2-hour idle auto-removal. Spots render on the panadapter with collision-avoidance stacking and click-to-tune, coloured by a DXCC 4-tier resolver against cty.dat plus the operator's ADIF log.

**Phase 3R: RADE as a true peer mode (RX + TX end-to-end).** RADE is wired as a first-class DSP mode (`DSPMode::RADE_U` / `DSPMode::RADE_L`) and not as a DIGU pretense, a virtual audio bus, or a slice-mute hack. RX decodes through a dedicated RadeChannel; the VFO flag gains a mode-aware SNR row and shows the EOO-decoded speaker callsign when known. TX is end-to-end: TxWorkerThread feeds the RADE encoder and `sendTxIq` carries the 24 kHz stereo modem output. RadeApplet docks in the right column when RADE is the active mode. Vendored `radae_nopy` (BSD-2-Clause) plus Opus with LPCNet/FARGAN add about 9 MB to the binary on every platform; neural-net weights are compiled into librade, so no external model file ships.

**Bench-fix tail.** Wire / parser / UX gaps that surfaced when 3J-1 + 3J-2 + 3R drafts hit real radios, real DX clusters, real WSJT-X feeds, and real WSJT-X TCI cycles. Highlights: first-MOX audio-volume seed, ten missing spot-client lifecycle wires, the DXSpider parser, FreeDV Reporter row-highlight / Socket.IO ACK push / VFO freq-publish throttle, the RADE callsign / idle-clear timer, and cross-source spot dedup via `SpotModel::dedupIndexFor`.

**Earlier releases.** **v0.4.0** (2026-05-08) shipped a substantial minor release on top of v0.3.2 with five pieces of work landing together: **3M-4 PureSignal** (the big new feature: feedback DDC plumbing on Protocol 1 and Protocol 2, `calcc.c` + `iqc.c` vendored verbatim from Thetis, PsForm dialog at Tools → PureSignal, AmpView modeless dialog, two-tone IMD overlay on the spectrum, bottom-banner FB+PS indicator pair, enabled on every supported P1 and P2 SKU including HL2 and plain Hermes), a **Display + DSP-Options refactor** (WDSP `avenger()` and `detector()` ports, new Setup → DSP page with 18 controls and RX/TX combo split, in-place filter resize, Filter Impulse Cache, Thetis-faithful FFT slider with 7 windows, NF-aware grid, SpectrumPeaksPage, Multimeter page, SettingsSchemaVersion v5 migration), **3M-3a-iv anti-VOX cancellation feed** (closes the v0.3.2 gap so the Anti-VOX gain control actually works; full grpAntiVOX trio on Setup → Transmit → DEXP/VOX), **live-apply sample rate** (no disconnect needed; 12-step Thetis-faithful coordinator routes through WDSP's `SetXcmInrate` path; HL2 P1 384 kHz parity), and the **AF Gain rewire (KM4BLG) + VAX bus calibration** (AF slider through `SetRXAPanelGain1` closes a long-standing distortion bug; VAX tap inverse-scales by `1 / afGain` so digital-mode apps stay calibrated). **v0.3.2** (2026-05-05) shipped DEXP/VOX speech processing end-to-end for the first time, the HL2 mi0bot RF/Tune slider maturity push, full Setup → PA parity + the PA over-drive safety hotfix for high-gain finals (notably the ANAN-8000DLE), and a long tail of persistence and stability fixes. **v0.3.1** (2026-05-03) carried forward everything 0.3.0 was supposed to deliver plus per-profile TX bandwidth control, the user-editable filter preset store, TX filter overlay on the panadapter and waterfall, the per-board PA forward-power calibration system, and the Setup IA reshape. **HL2 SSB transmit is bench-cleared** since v0.3.1's ATT/filter safety audit. Earlier-shipped 3G RX-Epic, 3P-A…I antenna integration, 3O VAX + Linux PipeWire, and the v0.2.x maintenance fixes still apply. **3M-2 CW TX** is next up; **3F multi-panadapter**, **3H skins**, **3K CAT** remain not-started.

### What's working end-to-end today

- **Radio connection — every OpenHPSDR P1 and P2 board.** ANAN-G2 (Saturn / Protocol 2), ANAN-10/10E/100/100B/100D/200D, Hermes, Hermes Lite 2, Angelia, Orion, Metis, Red Pitaya — all discover, connect, stream I/Q, demodulate through WDSP, and persist per-radio settings keyed by MAC. `BoardCapabilities` registry drives per-board DDC count, ADC count, BPF, Alex filter, and sample-rate support; `HardwareProfile` engine overlays Thetis `clsHardwareSpecific.cs` behaviour for ambiguous discovery bytes (user-selectable radio-model override in ConnectionPanel).
- **Sample-rate wiring** — P1 48 / 96 / 192 kHz (+ 384 on Red Pitaya); P2 48 / 96 / 192 / 384 / 768 / 1536 kHz. Per-MAC persistence under `hardware/<mac>/radioInfo/`. Inline reconnect banner on RadioInfoTab when the selected rate differs from the active wire rate.
- **Full Display parity** — `Setup → Display` (Spectrum / Waterfall / Grid & Scales) is wired end-to-end to the renderer on both the QPainter fallback and the QRhi/Metal/Vulkan/D3D12 GPU path. 47-control verification matrix at `docs/architecture/phase3g8-verification/README.md`. Per-band grid state persists across all 14 bands (160m–6m + GEN + WWV + XVTR) via the first-class `Band` enum on `PanadapterModel`.
- **Clarity adaptive display** — Clarity Blue waterfall palette, `ClarityController` with cadence / EWMA / deadband, `NoiseFloorEstimator` percentile, Reset-to-Smooth-Defaults button, Re-tune button + Clarity status badge in the spectrum overlay panel, per-band Clarity memory. Zoom persistence across restarts.
- **Full RX DSP parity** — 10 WDSP feature slices wired end-to-end through SliceModel → RadioModel → RxChannel → WDSP: AGC advanced (threshold / hang / slope / attack / decay), EMNR (NR2), SNB, APF (SPCW), 3-variant squelch (SSB / AM / FM), mute / audio pan / binaural, NB2 advanced, RIT / XIT client offset, frequency lock, mode containers (FM OPT / DIG / RTTY). Per-slice-per-band persistence under `Slice<N>/Band<key>/*`.
- **VfoWidget rewrite** — 4-tab layout (Audio / DSP / Mode / X-RIT), 4×2 DSP toggle grid, AGC 5-button row, S-meter level bar with dBm readout and cyan→green gradient, mode containers, tooltip coverage test. AGC-T ↔ RF Gain bidirectional sync prevents audio-breaking gain runaway.
- **Auto AGC-T** — `NoiseFloorTracker` feeds the Auto-threshold timer with MOX guard and `agcCalOffset`; AUTO button toggles auto-mode; right-click the AGC-T slider opens Setup directly on the AGC/ALC page.
- **Step attenuator + ADC overload** — `StepAttenuatorController` with Classic + Adaptive auto-attenuation modes, hysteresis, per-MAC persistence. P1/P2 `adcOverflow` signal from frame parsers, OVL status badge in RxApplet, per-model preamp items from Thetis `SetComboPreampForHPSDR`.
- **Container / meter system** — GPU-rendered meter engine (QRhi 3-pipeline), 31 `MeterItem` types, 38+ ItemGroup presets (S-Meter, Power/SWR, ALC, ANANMM 7-needle, CrossNeedle, Magic Eye, History, SignalText, TX bar meters), full Thetis-parity Container Settings Dialog (3-column layout, per-item property editors), MMIO external-data subsystem (UDP / TCP-listen / TCP-client / Serial transports; JSON / XML / RAW formats).
- **VAX audio routing** — NereusSDR-native multi-channel audio bus. `IAudioBus` abstraction with 5 platform backends (CoreAudio HAL plugin on macOS, PulseAudio pipes / pactl on Linux, PortAudio on Windows). First-run VAX dialog auto-detects Windows virtual-cable families (VB-Audio / VAC / Voicemeeter / Dante / FlexRadio DAX); `MasterOutputWidget` in the menu bar; Setup → Audio sub-tabs (Devices / VAX / TCI / Advanced); per-slice VAX channel assignment on the VFO Flag, persisted under `Slice<N>/`.
- **SSB voice transmit on every supported board, including Hermes Lite 2** — TxChannel, mic input pipeline (Pc / Radio / Composite sources), MOX state machine, I/Q output on Protocol 1 and Protocol 2. **TX speech processing chain**: 10-band parametric TX EQ, TX Leveler, TX ALC (3M-3a-i); CFC multi-band compressor, CPDR companding/drive ratio, CESSB controlled-envelope SSB, Phase Rotator (3M-3a-ii). **Per-profile TX bandwidth** (FilterLow/FilterHigh on every mic profile, TxApplet TX BW spinboxes, debounced WDSP path). 21 factory mic profiles ported verbatim from Thetis; profile manager with Save / Save-As / Delete; two-tone IMD test mode; VOX / DEXP / Anti-VOX. The HL2 ATT/filter safety audit closed in v0.3.1.
- **Connection workflow (Phase 3Q)** — single state-machine-driven `Disconnected → Probing → Connecting → Connected → (LinkLost | Disconnected)`. **Unicast probe** reaches radios across Layer-3 VPN tunnels (WireGuard / ZeroTier / Tailscale). 16-SKU model picker organized by silicon family in the Add Radio dialog. Auto-connect-on-launch with per-radio toggle. Spectrum disconnect overlay (fade + click-to-recover) replaces the v0.2.x "frozen spectrum" mystery state.
- **Status-bar chrome** — title-bar `ConnectionSegment` shows `[state dot] [▲ tx Mbps] [RTT ms] [▼ rx Mbps] [♪ audio]` with hover tooltip and right-click menu. Receive-info `BadgePair` ladder drops in priority order on narrow windows (mode + filter never drop). `StationBlock` clickable radio-name anchor. `AdcOverloadBadge` (yellow > 0, red > 3, 2 s auto-hide). CPU System / App right-click toggle. SVG icon system on `StatusBadge`. Min-filtered RTT for accurate sub-millisecond LAN ping readout.
- **Hermes Lite 2 configuration surface** — new Hermes Lite Options tab (I2C control, I/O pin state), N2ADR HERCULES toggle writing all 13 SWL pin-7 entries, signed −28..+32 dB step-attenuator range, 13 SWL bands × 7 pins matrix, full per-MAC persistence. Bigger gaps elsewhere in the app remain; this expands a previously-thin HL2 surface.
- **App polish** — Help → About NereusSDR (version / Qt / WDSP / GPG fingerprint / heritage credits), 💡 AI-assisted issue reporter in the menu bar corner (structured prompts, submits to the `bug_report.yml` / `feature_request.yml` GitHub templates), radio-model override persistence, P1 full 17-bank C&C round-robin, `NetworkDiagnosticsDialog` 4-section health grid.
- **Packaging** — `release.yml` prepare → build×3 → sign-and-publish pipeline. **macOS DMG and PKG are now Apple Developer ID-signed and notarized** in v0.3.0+; Windows installer remains unsigned (Authenticode certificate pending). All artifacts GPG-signed via `SHA256SUMS.txt.asc`. Per-platform artifacts: Linux AppImage (x86_64 + aarch64), macOS DMG + PKG (Apple Silicon + Intel), Windows portable ZIP + NSIS installer.

## Building from Source

### Dependencies

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev \
  qt6-multimedia-dev qt6-shadertools-dev qt6-svg-dev \
  cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  libfftw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev \
  libasound2-dev libjack-jackd2-dev \
  libpipewire-0.3-dev

# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-multimedia qt6-svg \
  cmake ninja pkgconf fftw \
  alsa-lib jack2 pipewire

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install qt@6 ninja cmake pkgconf fftw
```

The bundled PortAudio is built with `PA_USE_ALSA=ON` and `PA_USE_JACK=ON` on Linux,
so the ALSA and JACK development headers are required at compile time even if you
don't use those audio backends at runtime. `libpipewire-0.3-dev` (≥ 0.3.50) is
strongly recommended on PipeWire-default distributions (Ubuntu 24.04+, Fedora 39+,
Arch) — without it the Linux audio path falls back from the native libpipewire-0.3
bridge to the older pactl route.

### Windows (FFTW3 Setup)

No manual setup required. CMake auto-downloads [`fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip`](https://fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip) on first configure and drops `fftw3.h` / `libfftw3-3.dll` / `libfftw3-3.def` into `third_party/fftw3/`. Requires network access on the first `cmake -B build` run; offline builds need to pre-populate those three files by hand.

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boydsoftprez/NereusSDR.git
cd NereusSDR
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/NereusSDR
```

On first run, NereusSDR generates FFTW wisdom (optimized FFT plans). This takes ~15 minutes and shows a progress dialog. The wisdom file is cached for subsequent launches.

See [docs/MASTER-PLAN.md](docs/MASTER-PLAN.md) for the full implementation plan and [docs/project-brief.md](docs/project-brief.md) for the project brief.

// cited to Thetis / mi0bot at their own call sites.
//
// Bench report 2026-07-31 (JJ, KG4VCF), Hermes Lite 2 over a routed link:
// "when i connect it takes a retune to get things going ie no waterfall
// until i move the flag". Every I/Q packet between connect and the first
// VFO nudge was discarded:
//
//   P1: first ep6 frame received from "::ffff:x.x.x.17" (1032 bytes)
//   P1: first iqDataReceived emit; rx= 0 samples= 76
//   ReceiverManager: first feedIqData dropped; hwReceiverIndex= 0 map= "(empty)"
//
// An empty m_hwToLogical means no receiver was active, and
// rebuildHardwareMapping only maps active ones.
//
// connectToRadio activates receiver 0 (RadioModel.cpp:5527) and then calls
// bindUnboundSlices (:5579), whose requestDdcAssignment tail reaches
// publishDdcAssignment. At that point in the function the connection object
// does not exist yet (m_connection is assigned at :5855) and the codec has
// not been installed on ReceiverManager yet (wireConnectionSignals, called
// at :7674, does that). So computeDdcAssignment found no codec to ask and
// returned the default DdcAssignment, whose streamDdc is all -1, and the
// activation loop read that as "the radio is not streaming this" and
// deactivated the receiver that had been activated forty lines earlier.
//
// Nothing re-ran the assignment once the codec arrived, so the mapping
// stayed empty until the operator moved the VFO: frequencyChanged ->
// bindSliceToStream -> requestDdcAssignment, this time with a codec.
//
// Not the same fault as the suspended-stream deactivation
// (tst_suspended_stream_has_no_receiver): there the -1 was the codec's
// considered answer and honouring it is correct. Here there was no codec
// and therefore no answer at all, and the two must not be conflated --
// which is exactly what the shared -1 sentinel did.

// Phase 3I Task 10 — reconnection state machine test for P1RadioConnection.
//
// Tests the §3.6 state machine:
//   Connected → (2s silence) → LinkLost → (5s × up to 3 retries) → Connected or LinkLost
//
// Phase 3Q-1 note: ConnectionState::LinkLost was removed from the 5-value enum
// (Disconnected/Probing/Connecting/Connected/LinkLost). A watchdog timeout is
// semantically "link lost" (was connected; frames stopped), so Error → LinkLost.
//
// Uses P1FakeRadio auto-streaming (Task 10 addition: goSilent() stops ep6 output
// and resume() re-enables it, simulating a transient vs permanent radio failure).

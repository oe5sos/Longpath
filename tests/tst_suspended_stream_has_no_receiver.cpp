// no-port-check: NereusSDR-original. ReceiverManager activation is a
// NereusSDR construct; Thetis has no equivalent bookkeeping layer to
// port from. The DDC numbers asserted here are cited to Thetis.
//
// Bench report 2026-07-31 (JJ, KG4VCF): tuning up on slice B, the TUNE
// tone appeared on pan 0's waterfall and came out the speakers, while the
// transmitter was on slice B's pan.
//
// One cause for both symptoms. publishDdcAssignment decided receiver
// activation from "does this stream host slices", twenty lines after the
// suspension block decided from "did the codec give this stream a DDC".
// During PureSignal transmit those disagree completely: the Hermes-class
// PS branch hands every user stream -1 while every stream still holds its
// slices, so the loop re-activated receivers the radio had just stopped.
//
// An active receiver holds a DDC mapping. On the 1-ADC HERMES class slice
// A's stream maps to DDC0 (P2CodecHermes streamDdc[0] = 0) and
// PureSignal's feedback leg also uses DDC0 (psFwdDdc = 0, Thetis
// cmaster.cs:538 [v2.10.3.15] SetPSRxIdx(0, 0)). So the feedback leg,
// which carries the transmitted signal, arrived on a DDC pan 0's receiver
// was still listening to, and took the ordinary RX path: onto pan 0's FFT
// and through that slice's WDSP channel to the speakers.
//
// The recurring shape on this branch, and the most expensive instance of
// it so far: a check reading a different thing from the one the code
// decides on. Here the two were in the same function.

// tests/tst_cross_thread_teardown.cpp
//
// Regression test for the Windows shutdown/disconnect crash where
// RadioModel destroys a RadioConnection (and its worker-thread-affined
// QTimers) on the main thread after the worker QThread has already
// joined. Qt's "Timers cannot be stopped from another thread" check
// fires on destruction because the child timers' thread affinity is
// still the (exited) worker thread. On Windows this has terminated
// the process abnormally after disconnect-button clicks and after
// close-window shutdowns.
//
// The test reproduces the exact teardown pattern with P1RadioConnection:
// move the connection onto a worker thread, let init() create the
// timers on the worker, queue a disconnect() back on the worker, quit
// and join the thread, then destroy the connection on the main (test)
// thread. A Qt message handler counts any warning that contains the
// cross-thread timer string; the test passes only when zero such
// warnings are emitted.
//
// Issue #83 extension: the original helper posted disconnect()+
// deleteLater() via a plain queued invokeMethod, then immediately
// called thread->quit(). On Windows the event dispatcher's
// quit-processing races the queued MetaCall event, so the lambda was
// observed to never run before the loop exited. That left the socket
// open, metis-stop unsent, and the RadioConnection orphaned on a dead
// thread — crashing during later static-dtor cleanup and corrupting
// Winsock state badly enough that Thetis could not bind 51188 on the
// next session. The secondary assertion below verifies the fake
// received metis-stop, which only happens if disconnect() actually
// executed on the worker.

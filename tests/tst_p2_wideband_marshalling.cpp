//   names appear only inside source-cite comments documenting which
//   upstream line each constant comes from. No Thetis logic is ported.
//
// Phase 3F Sub-Epic I closeout. The widebandExtensionRequestedChanged
// handler that addSlice() wires called P2RadioConnection::
// setWidebandEnabled as a direct C++ call from the main / GUI thread.
// setWidebandEnabled writes m_wbEnableMask and, when connected, calls
// sendCmdGeneral(), which writes the UDP socket. RadioConnection lives
// on the connection thread that RadioModel::connectToRadio moves it to.
// So:
//
//   * m_wbEnableMask was torn — the connection thread could be
//     mid-compose of a CmdGeneral frame (byte 23 is the mask, Thetis
//     ChannelMaster/network.c:879 [v2.10.3.15]) while the GUI thread
//     rewrote it, putting a half-updated wideband enable on the wire;
//   * QUdpSocket::writeDatagram ran on a thread that owns neither the
//     socket nor its notifier.
//
// This is the third instance of the same pattern. The DDC-assignment
// instance is covered by tests/tst_p2_ddc_assignment_marshalling.cpp
// and republishAlexAdcSlices already marshalled correctly.
//
// The fix marshals through the functor overload of
// QMetaObject::invokeMethod, matching the hardwareReceiverCountChanged /
// hardwareFrequencyChanged / setAlexRxBpf / applyDdcAssignment pushes
// already in RadioModel. No qRegisterMetaType is involved: the functor
// overload packages the lambda itself, so the arguments travel as
// ordinary by-value captures rather than through the metatype system.

//
// Regression test for the GUI-thread fexchange2 deadlock.
//
// Background: prior to the introduction of RxDspWorker, RadioModel
// connected ReceiverManager::iqDataForReceiver to a same-thread lambda
// that called RxChannel::processIq → fexchange2 on the GUI main thread.
// fexchange2 is opened with bfo=1 and blocks on Sem_OutReady whenever
// the WDSP DSP loop has not replenished its output ring. Running it on
// the main thread caused a deterministic two-way deadlock between the
// main thread and WDSP's wdspmain: each side waited on the semaphore
// the other side was supposed to post, and because the main thread was
// blocked the Qt event loop stopped delivering more I/Q events to feed
// fexchange2.
//
// The fix is structural: I/Q processing now lives on a dedicated DSP
// thread inside RxDspWorker, fed by a Qt::QueuedConnection from
// ReceiverManager::iqDataForReceiver. This test verifies the structural
// invariants of that fix without needing a real WDSP build:
//
//   1. processIqBatch() runs on a thread that is NOT the test main
//      thread (i.e. the worker is being driven via a queued connection
//      after moveToThread()).
//   2. A burst of N back-to-back signals is processed without the
//      sender thread blocking on the worker — proving that even if a
//      future hypothetical fexchange2 call were to block inside the
//      worker, it cannot freeze the caller's event loop.
